She's a romantic and a smart-ass, she's earnest and well-meaning, she's got the attention span of a 12-year-old but the wisdom of someone far older. She's challenged me to be BIG and FUN but also grounded in the tragedies and reality of the play. Working with this cast and creative team has been so fun and fostered so much love! I'm especially sad to see my weeks and days working under Matt's direction wither away, it's been a wonderful and unforgettable 4 years.” - Talia Roland-Kalb ‘20\n•\n•\nCome see Talia as Little Sally in ‘Urinetown’, running from December 5th to 8th!", "org": "oberlin.theater"}
