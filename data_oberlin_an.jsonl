(Actually, my first experience with this play, The Misanthrope, was through a recorded audio performance that I found in my town’s public library—in my far-gone youth!) The great positive of performing this play this semester is that our actors—a truly wonderful ensemble drawn from all three on-campus classes—must focus on performing with their voices, still using all the tools of a fine actor to get to the ultimate expression of their characters, but in an audio world.”\n\nAnd, don’t worry, it’s not too late to register.
