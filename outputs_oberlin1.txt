This week’s SOSHA Hangout was an open discussion about sexual assault awareness month. The conversation began with a question: What does it mean for April to be sexual assault awareness month?

One student responded that it means “we have to talk about this stuff.” Another added that it also meant that there were more resources available during this time of year.

The group then discussed how Oberlin has been doing in terms of addressing sexual violence. One student noted that Oberlin has made progress but still needs to do more obie-wide obie-woide work.

SOSHA Craft Night at the Cat in the Cream

SOSHA hosted a craft night event on Thursday, Feb. 20 at the Cat in the Cream from 7-9 p.m., where students had the opportunity to make their own dreamcatchers and learn about their cultural significance. The event was free for Oberlin College students and included snacks and drinks.

The event had a low turnout with only three attendees. The event had originally been scheduled for last week but was defunded by Student Senate due to concerns over COVID-19 exposure risk.

“I’ve never had an event defunded before,” SOSHA President Ava Katz ’23 wrote in an email to the Review. “It was really disappointing because I know that there are so many people who would have loved to attend this eventue.”

Katz added that she had hoped to host more events like this one in the future.
