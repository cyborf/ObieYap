I’m writing this so that we remember to check in on our friends, especially those with a close connection to the Israeli-Palestinian territory. I’m writing this to raise awareness of how this issue has polarized and disconnected the Oberlin community.\n\nIt has been a complex and difficult experience to exist as a Jewish person at Oberlin who strongly believes in and advocates for the freedom of the Palestinian people. I do not believe that complex and difficult experiences should be avoided. It is through this discomfort that we can all grow into the best versions of ourselves, able to hold nuanced and compassionate opinions.\n\nIn times of tragedy and loss, it is of the utmost importance that we support each other in our grief and acknowledge the collective suffering that we are experiencing. Oberlin is a community that emphasizes the importance of empathy and compassion as well as justice and activism. But have we been holding ourselves true to these ideals? I’ve noticed that some of the activism that has been happening on campus lately does not seem to come from a space of compassion, and it is certainly not leading to any justice.\n\n📰Article by Andy Roshal \n📷Photo credits: Eloise Rich", "org": "ocreview"}

There has been a substantial amount of research on the impact that private research groups have on adopting sustainable technologies. However, private groups are not incentivized to research environmental technologies because the optimal path for them is to develop profitable innovations. On the other hand, little research has been conducted on the impact of public research organizations, though they may be the key to normalizing the usage of green technologies. Climate change is occurring at an astonishing rate, and the large corporations responsible for pollution need to become more ecologically thoughtful. Government legislation is crucial in motivating private industries to implement environmentally-friendly company policies.\"\n\nContinue reading in Issue 27 on our website.

In the past three years, Overall has released four critically acclaimed projects:  I THINK I’M GOOD (on Gilles Peterson’s Brownswood Recordings Imprint), GO GET ICE CREAM AND LISTEN TO JAZZ, and the mixtapes SHADES OF FLU and SHADES OF FLU 2, tilting the nexus of jazz and rap in unmapped, kaleidoscopic directions and gathering support from artistic visionaries including Virgil Abloh and Thom Yorke. Whatever the experiment, Overall remains faithful to the pocket of jazz drums in the tradition of his mentors, Elvin Jones, Billy Higgins, and Billy Hart, the latter of whom he studied at the Oberlin Conservatory of Music. \n\nFilling out Kassa’s all-star band is the Detroit-based keys player Ian Fink, who plays with Shigeto, Karriem Riggins, and Common; Haitian-American percussionist Bendji Allonce, son of Kompa legend Herman Nau who has worked with Miley Cyrus, Ms. Lauryn Hill, and Roberta Flack; and Tomoki Sanders (they/them), a multi-instrumentalist from Japan and New York who plays a saxophone given to them by their father, the great Pharoah Sanders.\n\nPresented by Oberlin Jazz Society @oberlin_jazz_society ! come through !", "org": "scoberlin"}

In readings, discussions, research and performance of scenes in class, we observe changes in voice, style and narrative in American theatrical writing.  As the end of the 20th century approached, how did these playwrights read their changing times, calculate the weight of history and invent new forms of expression?  How has that process continued into the 21st century? We interrogate the ways in which race, cultural identifications, gender, sexual orientation, gender identities, class and regionality play roles in the development of writers’ voices. \n\n📷 Tanya Rosen-Jones '97", "org": "oberlin.theater"}

{"input": "Write feature post about the Poiesis Quartet's success and formation", "output": "Quoted as an “emerging young ensemble to watch” by the Hyde Park Herald, the Poiesis Quartet was formed at Oberlin College and Conservatory during the fall semester of 2022. The members of the quartet are Conservatory fourth-year violinist Sarah Ying Ma, Conservatory fourth-year violinist Max Ball, violist Jasper de Boor, OC ’23, and double-degree fourth-year cellist Drew Dansby. The quartet found success very quickly, including achievements such as the gold medal at the Saint Paul String Quartet Competition and first place at the Fischoff National Chamber Music Competition. Only Dansby and Ma were interviewed for this article.\n\nHow did the quartet form? SYM: I wanted to do competitions, specifically the Fischoff Chamber Music Competition because I had never done it before. When I transferred from Juilliard in January 2022, I was looking for a group, but I didn’t know anybody. I asked Drew, because I knew we had mutual friends from social media. Originally, we were going for a piano trio, but we found Jasper and Max, and we got together to play. We all agreed on competitions as a group, and we did the Advanced Quartet Seminar together in our first semester.\n\nAt what point did you recognize your success as a group? SYM: After performing at the St. Paul Competition we listened back to our performance, and that was the first time I really thought to myself, “Oh, wow, we actually have something good.” And I remember before that I would listen to our recordings and always have a problem with it. I would think that we would never win anything. After the St. Paul Competition, we won the gold medal, and the BIPOC/Female Composer prize, which we did not think we would win.  But when we listened to it back, I felt like there’s something. There’s an energy here that I never had before in a chamber group. And I was interested in it. And I started exploring it more in rehearsals. I still — even to this day — think all four of us have doubts about ourselves as a group; we still question whether we could work together. But we are all committed to getting to a point where we feel secure in that.\n\n📰Article by: Emir Efe \n📷Photo credits: Peter Ringenberg", "org": "ocreview"}

There has been a recent (and very tragic) death in my family and I have resettled permanently  for emotional support. I also accepted an offer for an inaugural role as the director of diversity, equity, and inclusion for the Southern California Institute of Architecture.\nI have grown tremendously in the director role over the last two years and hope that I have helped further Oberlin’s commitment to increased belonging and persistence for BIPOC and LGBTQ+ students.\nI am deeply proud of the ways that we have committed and recommitted ourselves to standing up for each other. This includes your voluntary participation in new MRC workshops on allyship and disrupting anti-Blackness; faculty and staff participation in the Intergroup Dialogues on Race Talk; your sharing our digital resources on antiracism and mental health for BIPOC people; attending mental health roundtables and community welcomes, and even taking a break from a tense election season to de-stress with Obie pets.\nBut I am most proud of how we have shown up for each other during one of the most difficult and relentless times in human history. This pandemic has pushed us to the depths of ourselves, and we’re still here. Still committed. Still growing. Still possessing the audacity to stunt.\nAll MRC programs will continue as planned for the remainder of the spring semester with increased support from staff within the Division of Student Life.\nI have so much gratitude for past and present members of the Legendary Team MRC and the students, staff, and faculty whom I have gotten to know on a professional and personal level during my tenure.\nStay up,\nZahida\n_\nPhoto Credit: Jose Barrera ‘20","org": "obiemrc"}

Ocampo-Friedmann was born in Manila, Philippines and obtained a degree in botany from the University of the Philippines in 1958. She then completed her master’s at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem before returning to the Philippines to work. In 1973, she obtained a PhD at Florida State University. Ocampo-Friedmann and her husband often traveled to conduct research on algae and microorganisms. In particular, their trip to the Dry Valleys located in Antarctica was groundbreaking. The Dry Valleys are devoid of ice and snow and are characterized by their low humidity, so when the couple found microorganisms, now known as cryptoendoliths, living within the rock under extreme conditions, this discovery has implications for life in extreme environments. The couple successfully grew a culture of these microorganisms in a laboratory, and after writing a paper highlighting their discovery, their research supported the theory of the possibility of life on Mars.

An area that looked and felt different from the rest of their rooms so it was easy to distinguish between a work environment and a home environment. \n\nIn order to achieve that each space, regardless of if they share some characteristics, is unique in layout and setup, and a lot of the time have been expanded with items from the dancers personal collections. Each set and costume is inspired by the dancer's unique characters they created with the lighting and color pallete acting as a unifying element.“\n\nTo see more of Homer-Drummond’s initial design concepts, head over to @bigbadspender.\n\nSeen above: a collage of the initial design board for Big Spender’s costume design.\n\nYou can register NOW to see Big Spender which will be available to watch February 19 - 21 at the link in our bio.","org": "oberlin.theater"}

We have also come to understand the risk, although that process has been long and far more painful.

Images of broad-shouldered, well defined, and spray-tanned individuals holding a gallon jug of water probably come to mind. The science behind how those individuals came to look that way — and why they are carrying a gallon of water — is quite fascinating. Our understanding of what is required to achieve this hypermuscular state reaches down to the cellular level. Those who participate in bodybuilding must manipulate multiple metabolic pathways to achieve their desired result. The universal practice in this sport involves following a distinct diet combined with strenuous physical activity in order to minimize body fat and maximize muscle tissue. The Merriam Webster Dictionary defines bodybuilding as “the developing of the body through exercise and diet.” If bodybuilding was easy, then many more individuals would try to participate. It requires a substantial amount of discipline and mental strength. Critics may ask, “why going through such a rigorous diet and exercise routine is worth competing?” For those who make it to the professional level, the top placements receive prize money, and for many, the experience of winning is a compelling enough reason to continue.\"\n\nContinue reading in Issue 26 on our website.

She's a romantic and a smart-ass, she's earnest and well-meaning, she's got the attention span of a 12-year-old but the wisdom of someone far older. She's challenged me to be BIG and FUN but also grounded in the tragedies and reality of the play. Working with this cast and creative team has been so fun and fostered so much love! I'm especially sad to see my weeks and days working under Matt's direction wither away, it's been a wonderful and unforgettable 4 years.” - Talia Roland-Kalb ‘20\n•\n•\nCome see Talia as Little Sally in ‘Urinetown’, running from December 5th to 8th!", "org": "oberlin.theater"}

Retaining some exposure to stocks in your investment portfolio is one popular strategy because equity prices rise with inflation and tend to grow over time. In your fixed income portfolio, you can also consider using Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, whose value and interest payments adjust with inflation. - Motley Fool\n\nWe will be unpacking this on Monday, see you there✨", "org": "oberlinwnbfinance"}
