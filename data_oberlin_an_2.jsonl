A lot of it’s narration and a lot of it’s caricature, but also finding moments when it is being grounded in naturalism and grounded in emotional truths and balancing that between much more more playful, far less naturalist acting. \nNot every character has inner life and some only have it for like one moment.

It’s disgraceful.” 🔹\nIn his Letter to the Editor, Brunberg explains that numerous families have told him they were deceived into purchasing these plots, and only informed that upright gravestones were forbidden in that section when it came time to bury their loved ones. Ms. Lilli Faye Taylor, 84, “says that she can’t even find her husband’s grave anymore because the stone has sunk so far into the ground.” 🔹\nBrunberg reports that a cursory review of the section would indicate that up to 90% of the graves in Section S are those of African-Americans. 🔹\nClick the link in bio to read Brunberg’s letter in the Opinions section.

Our community is being sold out piece by piece by the Board of Trustees, a self-selecting group of wealthy individuals accountable to no one, who make disastrous, out-of-touch decisions in Wall Street back rooms and leave us with the consequences. \n\nLast semester, on March 30, we drew up a list of student demands (which can be found on our instagram or website, oberlinslac.org) and held a rally to present them to the College. This came after a protest organized by professor Yveline Alexis against the poor treatment of professors at Oberlin. We must build on this energy to continue the fight for better working and living conditions for the entire Oberlin community. \n\nThis semester, as the Board continues its heartless attacks on workers and organized labor at Oberlin, we will continue to fight for an end to austerity politics and the undemocratic trustee system. We must come together and build an Oberlin Community Forum where we can formulate our demands as a community and use our collective power to win. \n\nWe can't wait to fight alongside you to build a better world for the workers in our community and beyond. \n\nLove and solidarity,\nSLAC",

Alex spent one year as Musical Coordinator and three years as Co-Chair, before graduating in 2019 with a major in Musical Studies. During his time with OMTA, Alex music directed “The Musical of Musicals: The Musical”, “Assassins”, “Merrily We Roll Along”, and his original show, “Retold”. Alex is currently studying composition at the BMI Musical Theatre Workshop, where he collaborates with other theater writers to create original songs and shows. He has also music directed “Anything Goes” for Blue Hill Troupe’s 100th Anniversary, accompanied at Interlochen Arts Camp, and worked as a Music Assistant on the new musical “Baked!”\n\nAlex had this to say about his time working with OMTA: “I was thrust into my first OMTA show having never music directed before. I learned so much by just doing it, more than I ever would have learned from a class. Everything I do today as a music director I first learned back with OMTA shows — teaching music, conducting, playing piano — but also how to problem-solve, how to collaborate, and generally how to make theater happen with limited time and resources.”",

From Moscow to Warsaw and back again, Victor and Helya’s passionate desire matures into an altogether different and more moving kind of love. \nImpara saw A Warsaw Melody by accident in St. Petersburg while studying acting abroad at Moscow Art Theater in Russia. Intending to see a production of Ghosts by Henrik Ibsen, Impara learned it was sold out and chanced upon “A Warsaw Melody”. The piece of theater utterly captivated Impara. In her own words, “My first experience of this show left me with an ache, it is a powerful and very human story full of longing…I felt just as connected to the characters as I would have if I had understood the words they were saying.” Moving forward, both in her acting and direction, Impara wants to ensure she tells the story with more than just the language.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#OberlinCollegeTheater\xa0#OberlinCollege",

I wanted the set to have a dream-like quality. FUNNY GIRL. plays with space and time as it takes the audience on adventures through Anna’s childhood memories. The clouds that cover the wall and floor is a way to show Anna floating through life. She has all these experiences that shape who she is today, yet she is unable to realize the extent to which those stories have affected her.\n\n Performance is another huge aspect to FUNNY GIRL. By using a bright red couch in the center of the stage, I wanted to call back to an old-time Broadway style of bright colors. The poster on the wall that says “Hang in There” was Anna’s idea, and it is the only thing on stage that is actually real, verses in Anna’s imagination. Laura Carlson-Tarantowski was a huge help throughout this design process. The Kander Theater additionally made for a wonderful little and intimate space to perform this play!”\n \nOne more day to register! At the link in our bio",

I knew I wanted to do research when I was in the process of applying to colleges. After that, I knew I wanted to do research on people from marginalized communities , particularly ethnic minority elementary students from low income backgrounds. I wanted to do research on these groups to see what resources they are lacking compared to their more affluent counterparts and see what resources and intervention can we implement. Working in Professor Wilson’s lab has allowed me to start accomplishing this goal. \n𝑾𝒉𝒂𝒕 𝒌𝒊𝒏𝒅 𝒐𝒇 𝒓𝒆𝒔𝒆𝒂𝒓𝒄𝒉 𝒂𝒓𝒆 𝒚𝒐𝒖 𝒅𝒐𝒊𝒏𝒈? I’m looking at the correlation between the teacher-student relationship and student academic performance, as well as the correlation between being liked by peers and student academic performance. The data set I am working with is composed of predominantly Black, low-income students. Which is the population I am deeply interested in helping. I’m also analyzing it by grade level and gender.

I don't have that much experience yet as an upcoming first year, but I definitely plan to continue research in the Psychology department even though I plan on being a neuroscience major. The research has been a little overwhelming but having the opportunity to do this now has helped me manage my anxiety and learn that I can ask my professors and mentors for help and advice.

I think the themes of yearning and pining but also just letting loose and being a party animal and going crazy is relatable but it's also historical. I love the way that Viola’s character is created and the way that her internal life is given credit and is given a space on the stage. It's a great play, there’s a lot of really fun characters and really fun elements, and there’s a lot of fun things you can do with it.

        "output": "From Nov. 2–4, the Oberlin Opera Theater will present Benjamin Britten’s satirical comedy Albert Herring. This production features the Oberlin Chamber Orchestra and a double cast from the Conservatory’s Vocal Studies division. This performance was directed by Visiting Assistant Professor of Opera Theater Stephanie Havey, marking her first production with the Oberlin Opera Theater. The whole piece comes alive under the baton of Michael Sakir, OC ’06.\n\nThe story takes place in Loxford, a small town in East Suffolk, England. The town folk hurry to find a new May Queen for the upcoming May Festival. Because the people of Loxford prize purity, the purest of them all wins said title. The May Queen is usually a virgin woman; however, no more virgins exist, so they must reluctantly award the May Queen title to the most virginal man in town, Albert Herring. \n\nHavey’s set design showcased Loxford with tall pink and gold two-dimensional buildings that frame the stage and brilliantly capture the town’s rigidity with an Addams Family-esque portrayal of the town folk — pale-faced, lifeless, and morally dubious, yet somehow likable. However, the town’s youth seemed rosy-cheeked and full of life. The gothic appearance of the older townspeople in contrast with the lively color palette of its youth show that time spent within this society will surely wear away at all who abide by Loxford’s morals.\n\n📰Article by Chris Leimgruber\n📷Photo credits: Erin Koo",

Dad would leave the house on weekdays because he is an essential worker at an oil refinery. He would pick up the groceries and run any necessary errands. My mom, a box office manager at a local theatre, did her best to work from home. The day after I returned from college, the first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in Lucas County, an area in Northwest Ohio on the border with Michigan. We were nervous, of course, but we did not think we would get it.”\n\nContinue reading on our website in Issue 25.

More about Kassa, his music, and band:\n•\nKassa Overall, a Grammy-nominated musician, emcee, singer, producer and drummer, will be returning to Oberlin, his alma mater, on Tuesday April 12 — his first performance at Oberlin since 2019. \n\nKassa has been called “one of modern jazz music’s most audacious futurists” by Pitchfork. In the past three years, Overall has released four critically acclaimed projects:  I THINK I’M GOOD (on Gilles Peterson’s Brownswood Recordings Imprint), GO GET ICE CREAM AND LISTEN TO JAZZ, and the mixtapes SHADES OF FLU and SHADES OF FLU 2, tilting the nexus of jazz and rap in unmapped, kaleidoscopic directions and gathering support from artistic visionaries including Virgil Abloh and Thom Yorke. Whatever the experiment, Overall remains faithful to the pocket of jazz drums in the tradition of his mentors, Elvin Jones, Billy Higgins, and Billy Hart, the latter of whom he studied at the Oberlin Conservatory of Music. \n\nFilling out Kassa’s all-star band is the Detroit-based keys player Ian Fink, who plays with Shigeto, Karriem Riggins, and Common; Haitian-American percussionist Bendji Allonce, son of Kompa legend Herman Nau who has worked with Miley Cyrus, Ms. Lauryn Hill, and Roberta Flack; and Tomoki Sanders (they/them), a multi-instrumentalist from Japan and New York who plays a saxophone given to them by their father, the great Pharoah Sanders.",

Fires in the Mirror gives a unique perspective on histories of racial prejudice and, in the time of Black Lives Matter, the play is a damning reminder of how deeply divided this nation remains.\n\nW/ FREE, ONLINE ONLY ADVANCED REGISTRATION REQUIRED AVAILABLE ONLY: APRIL 2, 3, & 4\n\nTo access the film, stay tuned for the registration link.",
