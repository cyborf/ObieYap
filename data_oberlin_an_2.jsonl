A lot of it’s narration and a lot of it’s caricature, but also finding moments when it is being grounded in naturalism and grounded in emotional truths and balancing that between much more more playful, far less naturalist acting. \nNot every character has inner life and some only have it for like one moment.

It’s disgraceful.” 🔹\nIn his Letter to the Editor, Brunberg explains that numerous families have told him they were deceived into purchasing these plots, and only informed that upright gravestones were forbidden in that section when it came time to bury their loved ones. Ms. Lilli Faye Taylor, 84, “says that she can’t even find her husband’s grave anymore because the stone has sunk so far into the ground.” 🔹\nBrunberg reports that a cursory review of the section would indicate that up to 90% of the graves in Section S are those of African-Americans. 🔹\nClick the link in bio to read Brunberg’s letter in the Opinions section.

Our community is being sold out piece by piece by the Board of Trustees, a self-selecting group of wealthy individuals accountable to no one, who make disastrous, out-of-touch decisions in Wall Street back rooms and leave us with the consequences. \n\nLast semester, on March 30, we drew up a list of student demands (which can be found on our instagram or website, oberlinslac.org) and held a rally to present them to the College. This came after a protest organized by professor Yveline Alexis against the poor treatment of professors at Oberlin. We must build on this energy to continue the fight for better working and living conditions for the entire Oberlin community. \n\nThis semester, as the Board continues its heartless attacks on workers and organized labor at Oberlin, we will continue to fight for an end to austerity politics and the undemocratic trustee system. We must come together and build an Oberlin Community Forum where we can formulate our demands as a community and use our collective power to win. \n\nWe can't wait to fight alongside you to build a better world for the workers in our community and beyond. \n\nLove and solidarity,\nSLAC",

Alex spent one year as Musical Coordinator and three years as Co-Chair, before graduating in 2019 with a major in Musical Studies. During his time with OMTA, Alex music directed “The Musical of Musicals: The Musical”, “Assassins”, “Merrily We Roll Along”, and his original show, “Retold”. Alex is currently studying composition at the BMI Musical Theatre Workshop, where he collaborates with other theater writers to create original songs and shows. He has also music directed “Anything Goes” for Blue Hill Troupe’s 100th Anniversary, accompanied at Interlochen Arts Camp, and worked as a Music Assistant on the new musical “Baked!”\n\nAlex had this to say about his time working with OMTA: “I was thrust into my first OMTA show having never music directed before. I learned so much by just doing it, more than I ever would have learned from a class. Everything I do today as a music director I first learned back with OMTA shows — teaching music, conducting, playing piano — but also how to problem-solve, how to collaborate, and generally how to make theater happen with limited time and resources.”",

From Moscow to Warsaw and back again, Victor and Helya’s passionate desire matures into an altogether different and more moving kind of love. \nImpara saw A Warsaw Melody by accident in St. Petersburg while studying acting abroad at Moscow Art Theater in Russia. Intending to see a production of Ghosts by Henrik Ibsen, Impara learned it was sold out and chanced upon “A Warsaw Melody”. The piece of theater utterly captivated Impara. In her own words, “My first experience of this show left me with an ache, it is a powerful and very human story full of longing…I felt just as connected to the characters as I would have if I had understood the words they were saying.” Moving forward, both in her acting and direction, Impara wants to ensure she tells the story with more than just the language.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#OberlinCollegeTheater\xa0#OberlinCollege",

I wanted the set to have a dream-like quality. FUNNY GIRL. plays with space and time as it takes the audience on adventures through Anna’s childhood memories. The clouds that cover the wall and floor is a way to show Anna floating through life. She has all these experiences that shape who she is today, yet she is unable to realize the extent to which those stories have affected her.\n\n Performance is another huge aspect to FUNNY GIRL. By using a bright red couch in the center of the stage, I wanted to call back to an old-time Broadway style of bright colors. The poster on the wall that says “Hang in There” was Anna’s idea, and it is the only thing on stage that is actually real, verses in Anna’s imagination. Laura Carlson-Tarantowski was a huge help throughout this design process. The Kander Theater additionally made for a wonderful little and intimate space to perform this play!”\n \nOne more day to register! At the link in our bio",

I knew I wanted to do research when I was in the process of applying to colleges. After that, I knew I wanted to do research on people from marginalized communities , particularly ethnic minority elementary students from low income backgrounds. I wanted to do research on these groups to see what resources they are lacking compared to their more affluent counterparts and see what resources and intervention can we implement. Working in Professor Wilson’s lab has allowed me to start accomplishing this goal. \n𝑾𝒉𝒂𝒕 𝒌𝒊𝒏𝒅 𝒐𝒇 𝒓𝒆𝒔𝒆𝒂𝒓𝒄𝒉 𝒂𝒓𝒆 𝒚𝒐𝒖 𝒅𝒐𝒊𝒏𝒈? I’m looking at the correlation between the teacher-student relationship and student academic performance, as well as the correlation between being liked by peers and student academic performance. The data set I am working with is composed of predominantly Black, low-income students. Which is the population I am deeply interested in helping. I’m also analyzing it by grade level and gender.

I don't have that much experience yet as an upcoming first year, but I definitely plan to continue research in the Psychology department even though I plan on being a neuroscience major. The research has been a little overwhelming but having the opportunity to do this now has helped me manage my anxiety and learn that I can ask my professors and mentors for help and advice.

I think the themes of yearning and pining but also just letting loose and being a party animal and going crazy is relatable but it's also historical. I love the way that Viola’s character is created and the way that her internal life is given credit and is given a space on the stage. It's a great play, there’s a lot of really fun characters and really fun elements, and there’s a lot of fun things you can do with it.

        "output": "From Nov. 2–4, the Oberlin Opera Theater will present Benjamin Britten’s satirical comedy Albert Herring. This production features the Oberlin Chamber Orchestra and a double cast from the Conservatory’s Vocal Studies division. This performance was directed by Visiting Assistant Professor of Opera Theater Stephanie Havey, marking her first production with the Oberlin Opera Theater. The whole piece comes alive under the baton of Michael Sakir, OC ’06.\n\nThe story takes place in Loxford, a small town in East Suffolk, England. The town folk hurry to find a new May Queen for the upcoming May Festival. Because the people of Loxford prize purity, the purest of them all wins said title. The May Queen is usually a virgin woman; however, no more virgins exist, so they must reluctantly award the May Queen title to the most virginal man in town, Albert Herring. \n\nHavey’s set design showcased Loxford with tall pink and gold two-dimensional buildings that frame the stage and brilliantly capture the town’s rigidity with an Addams Family-esque portrayal of the town folk — pale-faced, lifeless, and morally dubious, yet somehow likable. However, the town’s youth seemed rosy-cheeked and full of life. The gothic appearance of the older townspeople in contrast with the lively color palette of its youth show that time spent within this society will surely wear away at all who abide by Loxford’s morals.\n\n📰Article by Chris Leimgruber\n📷Photo credits: Erin Koo",

Dad would leave the house on weekdays because he is an essential worker at an oil refinery. He would pick up the groceries and run any necessary errands. My mom, a box office manager at a local theatre, did her best to work from home. The day after I returned from college, the first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in Lucas County, an area in Northwest Ohio on the border with Michigan. We were nervous, of course, but we did not think we would get it.”\n\nContinue reading on our website in Issue 25.

More about Kassa, his music, and band:\n•\nKassa Overall, a Grammy-nominated musician, emcee, singer, producer and drummer, will be returning to Oberlin, his alma mater, on Tuesday April 12 — his first performance at Oberlin since 2019. \n\nKassa has been called “one of modern jazz music’s most audacious futurists” by Pitchfork. In the past three years, Overall has released four critically acclaimed projects:  I THINK I’M GOOD (on Gilles Peterson’s Brownswood Recordings Imprint), GO GET ICE CREAM AND LISTEN TO JAZZ, and the mixtapes SHADES OF FLU and SHADES OF FLU 2, tilting the nexus of jazz and rap in unmapped, kaleidoscopic directions and gathering support from artistic visionaries including Virgil Abloh and Thom Yorke. Whatever the experiment, Overall remains faithful to the pocket of jazz drums in the tradition of his mentors, Elvin Jones, Billy Higgins, and Billy Hart, the latter of whom he studied at the Oberlin Conservatory of Music. \n\nFilling out Kassa’s all-star band is the Detroit-based keys player Ian Fink, who plays with Shigeto, Karriem Riggins, and Common; Haitian-American percussionist Bendji Allonce, son of Kompa legend Herman Nau who has worked with Miley Cyrus, Ms. Lauryn Hill, and Roberta Flack; and Tomoki Sanders (they/them), a multi-instrumentalist from Japan and New York who plays a saxophone given to them by their father, the great Pharoah Sanders.",

Fires in the Mirror gives a unique perspective on histories of racial prejudice and, in the time of Black Lives Matter, the play is a damning reminder of how deeply divided this nation remains.\n\nW/ FREE, ONLINE ONLY ADVANCED REGISTRATION REQUIRED AVAILABLE ONLY: APRIL 2, 3, & 4\n\nTo access the film, stay tuned for the registration link.",

These stories intersect to create a collage-like slice-of-life portrait of this particular group of women, at this crucial stage in their lives, in a very specific sociological setting.”\n\n- Paul Moser, Director of Twilight Bowl\n\n📷 Jonathon Clark",

The event had to be canceled and we were disheartened that all of that hard work could not come to fruition as we imagined. However, we recognize that adaptability in a time like this is essential to our wellbeing. While we cannot offer a show on the same scale in the same way, we wanted to offer a fun and virtual alternative.\n\nShelter-in-place restrictions are in place to protect us but they also present an issue to people of an LGBTQ+ experience. Not every person can fully express themselves safely and/or comfortably at home. We see you and we love you. We wanted to do what we could to let you know that no matter where you are we are still family, you are still valid, and wanted to present an opportunity to reconnect with our community. It is not a perfect alternative but it is one that we wanted to provide to continue the legacy of perseverance that Drag Ball embodies and celebrates. \nWe love you and hope to see you tonight! ❤️**",

Born and raised in West Virginia, Johnson was a gifted child in mathematics and quickly advanced in her schooling. At the age of 18, she enrolled into West Virginia State College and in 1937, she graduated with two degrees in mathematics and French. She taught math and French for several years until 1952, when she was recruited to perform and check calculations at the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), now known as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Because of her great curiosity and expertise in mathematics, she advanced to leading the initiative of sending a man into orbit in 1962. Johnson successfully performed these difficult calculations with extreme accuracy. This was only the beginning of her work at NASA, as she also performed the calculations of the Apollo 11 journey to the moon in 1969 and ensured a safe return to Earth of Apollo 13 after malfunctioning. Furthermore, she expanded the Space Shuttle program until 1986, when she retired. For her dedication to NASA, Katherine Johnson was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2015. At 101 years old, Johnson passed away on February 24, 2020.

Daly grew up in New York, where she graduated magna cum laude from Queens College in 1942. Daly earned her master’s at New York University and her PhD Columbia University. After graduating, Daly began work as a science instructor at Howard University, while also conducting research on the cell nucleus. Daly then began work as an assistant professor of biochemistry at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. During her time there, not only was she an esteemed researcher, but she also was dedicated to increasing the minority enrollment at the college. Daly's research on histones is now considered to be fundamental to the field of biochemisty, and her work on protein synthesis was crucial in the discovery on DNA. After retiring from Albert Einstein College, Daly initiated a scholarship at Queens College for Black students to pursue chemistry and physics in memory of her father. OUR celebrates Marie Daly's salient work in biochemistry and also her dedication to giving underrepresented students opportunities in STEM. #diversity #OUR #oberlin #research",

The panel, hosted by Career Exploration and Development, was connected to Obiewood, the alumni network for Obies working in film and television.\n\n“Obiewood is the name of the alumni group that is ‘Obies in Hollywood,’” Kyle Farris, assistant director for career readiness, said. “It’s a loose kind of alumni association for folks who are involved in or looking to break into the entertainment industry.”\nObiewood primarily functions in Los Angeles, where panels, mixers, and other events allow alumni of all years to create connections and foster relationships that can lead to job opportunities.\n\n“The whole idea of it is to provide graduates with a community that could provide support and connect people to other resources,” Farris said. “It’s primarily focused on the alumni side of things, which is why I’m really happy that they were kind enough to come in and talk to the current students. But I know that folks out there will sometimes try to arrange mixers, or networking events, or just help each other out one-on-one.”\n\n📰Article by Kathleen Kelleher\n📷Photo credits: Ron Knerem",

Click the link in bio and head to the Opinions section to read their stories! 🔶\nA sneak peek: “After you order your Go Mango Go smoothie (Rita’s favorite, by the way), you watch Rita simultaneously manning the register and stocking the fruit and are impressed with her work ethic. Did you know Rita is a veteran Stevie worker and has been here for the past 18 years? She spent most of that time at the deli bar, where she had the chance to get to know student workers. One of those workers, with whom she formed a special bond, came back after graduating to reconnect and give her a handknit scarf.” 🔶\nAlso in our Opinions section this week: Booker Peek on the Democratic strategy for the Georgia runoffs; and Khalid and Zoë answer your burning questions on whether water’s wet, when to brush your teeth, and if going barefoot is OK. 🔶\n📸 by Sydney Rosensaft",

With book and lyrics by Cyril Amanfo ‘22 and original music by Cyril Amanfo, Max Addae ‘21, and Mark Ligonde ‘22, the world premiere production of Olympus is for the people, by the people.

SOSHA must be able to meet those needs. Intersectionality is an active state — a practice of sustainable learning and collective healing. We are constantly reevaluating our methodologies, programming, and leadership in order to account for the evolution of the needs of the Oberlin community.\n\nAs we leave campus for the summer, we want to affirm to survivors that SOSHA exists for you — however you choose to process, heal, or sit with your experiences. In a variety of ways, we are committed to support, advocacy, and education for the Oberlin community. You are our peers, friends, and fellow survivors. We are working to foster equitable spaces that allow for active dialogue, education, and cross-cultural understanding, especially for queer and BIPOC survivors.\n\nWe are excited to announce plans for an expansion of BIPOC and LGBTQ Listening Sessions, individual peer-to-peer support, spaces for male & masculine survivors, and a slew of educational and advocacy programs next semester.\n\nWith Love,\nMary Ann, Sage, and Sydney",

More info on proposals and how to sign up below!!\n•\n•\n•\n\nOMTA/OSTA approves two or, on rare occasions, more productions at the beginning of each semester or winter term. During the proposal meeting, people proposing shows will be called in one at a time. You will have about 5-7 minutes to pitch to the board the show you are proposing (just some stuff like what the show's about, why you want to direct it, etc.). Sometimes people have slideshows or other visuals to help with their proposal. After your pitch, you might be asked questions by the board. Generally, the more you have prepared, the more likely your proposal is to get approved. This could even be something like already having a set blueprint or blocking notes, but that's not a necessity. What typically is important is having most or all of a production team assembled when you propose (stage manager, lighting designer, sound designer, etc.). Rights are applied for after your proposal is approved.\n—\nPlease note, OMTA already has a musical booked in Wilder Main, so we can only accept an OSTA play this semester to perform in that space. However, if you wish to hold your musical in the Cat or still want us to consider your musical proposal, feel free to still submit one!",
