Abstract: Artificial intelligence (psychology) is the study of how to make computers do things that require intelligence when done by humans. It is related to the similar task of using computers to understand human intelligence, but AI does not have to confine itself to methods that are biologically observable or psychologically credible; it can draw on mathematical modeling, computer science, and engineering ingenuity to develop intelligent behavior in oblivious systems. Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence concerned with the design and development of algorithms that allow machines to learn from data and improve their performance over time. ML algorithms are used for tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, and

Boba is a popular drink among international students at the University of Oregon, and it’s not hard to see why! This delicious beverage combines chewy tapioca pearls with sweet syrup and milk or tea for a refreshing and satisfying treat. For many international students, boba is morethan just a drink; it’s a cultural experience that connects them to their home countries and creates a sense of community with other international students on campus. Whether enjoying boba with friends or sipping on a cup while studying, this beloved drink brings a touch of international flavor to life in Eugene! 🍵🌍🌟 International student and scholar service (ISSS) staff members love bonding over boba with their international student clients. It's a great way to connect over shared culture and enjoy a delicious treat together! 🌟🥛👩‍🎓🌐 #internationalstudentlife #bobatea #culturalconnection #ISSS #UpsideDownWorld #InternationalStudentAndScholarService #GlobalCommunity #TasteTheWorld #BobaLove 🌟🍽

Pizza at 1PM Monday, then a trip to the zscaler office for some networking.

I’ve been meaning to get out and see more of the city since moving here in January. I’m not sure why it took me so long to do this, but better late then never!

The pizza was delicious and the company was great. We chatted about all sorts of things from work to life outside the office. It was nice to catch up with everyone over a slice or two (or three).

After lunch we headed off to the zscaler office where we met up with some colleagues for some networking fun. The atmosphere was buzzing as people mingled and caught up on what’s new in their lives.

Overall it was an enjoyable day filled with good food, friendly faces, and plenty of conversation. Looking forward to doing it again soon! 🍕🌟 Networking with friends at zscaler office #pizzaparty #networkingfun #friendshipgoals
