At 19, hooks began writing her book \"Ain't I a Woman\", published a decade later. bell hooks continued her higher education and eventually obtained a doctorate in English literature at the University of California, Santa Cruz. After that, she began her teaching career, which she considered to be the most powerful form of political resistance. Some of the schools she instructed were the University of Southern California, Yale University, and Oberlin College. Throughout her life, bell hooks wrote over 30 books and many scholarly articles before passing away on December 15, 2021.

Ever since, she’s had a wonderful partnership with Oberlin, working with students at the oasis for over ten years and keeping in contact with Oberlin alumni. She says having the first-year students come up for Connect Cleveland every year is the “icing on the broccoli.” \n\nWhen reflecting on the importance of the Oasis, she says, “Not only do we grow things here, but it’s a place where, under the pergola, you can come and sit and relax and just de-stress. It’s so peaceful here. It’s a place where, without any bother at all or without any obstruction, you can just come and be who you are. You can come as you are.”\n\nTo our incoming first-years, remember Vel’s advice. Come as you are.

Lights are strewn about the town and we can daydream about cozying up with a cappuccino or hot chocolate in Slow Train while neglecting final papers and exams. As the semester winds down, the College and City offer an array of activities and festivities to accompany the magical sparkle of the wintertime chill.\n\nThis past week, the Office of Student Leadership and Involvement and the Oberlin College Program board hosted Ornament and Card Making in Wilder Main Space. This event, designed to ease students into the holidays, was created and has been operated by Director of Student Involvement Tina Zwegat since she started at Oberlin. Student Involvement Coordinator Shaina Lin Chung, OC ‘22, emphasized the importance of the event for relieving stress in this often stressful time.\n\n“This event requires as little or as much time as you want to dedicate to it,” Chung wrote in an email to the Review. “I stopped by Wilder Main, and someone was playing the ‘Skating’ theme by the Vince Guaraldi Trio on piano. … I see students enjoy themselves as they make funny or sentimental cards for their friends, ornaments for Hanukkah, Christmas, or Kwanzaa, and craft snowmen out of available materials. It can be a cozy laid-back atmosphere where students take their time with their ornaments and sit silently diligently while they craft. I’ve also seen students festive and lively”\n\n📰Article by Eloise Rich\n📷Photo credits: Jason Shaffer", "org": "ocreview"}

{"input": "Feature former OSTA member Sarah Lariviere", "output": "This week we’re shining a spotlight on former OSTA member and performer Sarah Lariviere! Sarah graduated from Oberlin in 1997 with a major in Theater, and a concentration in Acting. In addition to managing props for OSTA, she performed in several OSTA productions, including “Equus” directed by Greg Copeland ‘94, “The House of Blue Leaves” directed by Rachel Claff ‘95, and “The Visit” directed by Thomas Kriegsmann ‘98. Sarah became a social worker after graduation, working with kids and families for over a decade, and has been an author for the past decade. She credits her theatrical training as having helped in both of these areas; using listening skills and improv skills to keep clients engaged and connected in social work, and writing a book requires her to play the role of writer, actors, director, lighting designer, scenery designer, sound person, etc. Her new novel, Riot Act, comes out in July 2024 from Knopf: “It’s an alternate history about theater kids fighting for freedom of expression in an authoritarian America. Theater was a lifeline for me, and continues to be, even indirectly.”\n\nSarah had this to say about how her time working with OSTA has influenced her life and work: “Learning to collaborate in service of something greater than myself, staying in the moment, trying not to bury my true feelings, or play life small. As an author, I have to be free to make bold, confident choices that are deeply emotionally connected to try to reach readers who want to feel something. That’s acting, but it’s also being authentic, in a big way. I’m still practicing every day, trying to learn how to do that.”", "org": "omta_osta"}

Across many of his shows the techniques are pretty relevant and they all culminate in The Tempest, so that’s why I chose it as an educational piece to direct. I think a lot of what I’m learning while directing this specific show is how to communicate with many facets of people as it does require intense technical skill and a lot of design from other people, not just with the actors.” \nSee The Tempest July 31, August 3rd and August 5th!\n\n📷: Clarissa Heart", "org": "oberlin.theater"}

The play centers on 30-year-old Ty Green, a normal guy now faced with three very big problems. In an unprecedented run of promiscuity in the span of only a week, Ty manages to impregnate three women: his ex- girlfriend, his 40-something, married next-door neighbor, and his 18-year-old student. \"All This Intimacy\" distinctly attracted Bowman because of the comedy’s absolute absurdity. Bowman wanted to explore how real people would navigate a normally unrealistic turn of events. If the director grounds the play in the each of the characters’ realities than, as she states, it doesn’t matter how absurd the situation is because the audience can find humanity through the humor. As the New York Times presents All This Intimacy it has a certain can’t-look-away pull quality that poses the question: How would you face your own worst nightmare scenario?\n📷 Chris Schmuki\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#OberlinCollegeTheater #OberlinCollege", "org": "oberlin.theater"}

For theater artists, Zoom inhabits a space somewhere between live performance and digital recording that we are still in the process of mapping out. \n\nFor this production of Fires in the Mirror, we have embraced the unfortunately familiar aesthetic of Zoom as we perform in this uncharted territory. Performance on theZoom is neither live theater, nor is it fully edited filmmaking. Technology and slick production technique has rendered the artifice of realistic filmmaking invisible to the general public. Since Fires in the Mirror deals with issues of identity and subjective perspectives, in our design we have embraced artificiality and foregrounded the technology we are using for our production. Both the script and our design acknowledge that any performative re-creation of an historical event are necessarily distanced from an mediated for the viewer.” \n- Jason Dorwart, Director of Fires in the Mirror\n\nRegister for Fires in the Mirror from the link in our bio!\n\nPictured above: Laura Carlson-Tarantowski renderings of the film's aesthetic", "org": "oberlin.theater"}

Unapologetically.\n\nToday, we take stock of our victories and the fight ahead in the best way we know how. We celebrate what makes us Black, beautiful and free.\n\nWelcome to SIX NINETEEN. We invite you to join us this weekend (online or in your community) to take action and make our voices heard. We demand the defunding of the police. We demand an investment in Black communities. We demand the resignation of Donald Trump. We demand to be heard. While we celebrate Blackness and the joy of existing freely, we also are committed to the fight against limitations on our freedom.\n\nToday, we focus on investing in our futures. That means divesting from police and investing in our communities and our needs (education, affordable housing, jobs, etc). Tomorrow, we focus on the cost of inaction. Sunday, we focus on Trump’s resignation. All of these themes fit into our SIX NINETEEN action weekend. We are actively organizing toward freedom.\n\nToday, we speak in one voice, in the names of those we have lost and the futures of those who would come after us. This, too, is democracy. Find ways to action virtually or in your community at sixnineteen.com. WELCOME TO SIXNINETEEN. ——\nIt is important to note that one of the most important things about activism is long-sustained activism. Do your part. Educate. Donate.

It’s been a great time thanks to everybody.\n𝑾𝒉𝒂𝒕 𝒌𝒊𝒏𝒅 𝒐𝒇 𝒓𝒆𝒔𝒆𝒂𝒓𝒄𝒉 𝒂𝒓𝒆 𝒚𝒐𝒖 𝒅𝒐𝒊𝒏𝒈?\nMy research is to build a computer system that effectively emulates emotions in computers. It has been broken down into two parts, though. The first part is recognizing what the users are feeling, and the second part is reacting to what the users are feeling. This summer, I’ve been focused on the first part, which is recognizing what the users are feeling based on facial cues that we see from the webcam. \n𝑯𝒐𝒘 𝒉𝒂𝒔 𝒕𝒉𝒊𝒔 𝒓𝒆𝒔𝒆𝒂𝒓𝒄𝒉 𝒔𝒉𝒂𝒑𝒆𝒅 𝒚𝒐𝒖𝒓 𝒆𝒅𝒖𝒄𝒂𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏?\nI have always had an interest in machine and artificial intelligence and how it works. It was sort of like a  magic black box sorcery kind of thing before I started it. I had absolutely no background in machine learning at all. I just knew I wanted to do it because it’s so interesting. Professor Eck is an amazing amazing mentor, and he really helped me get into this field and understand whats going on and remove that sense of sorcery from this field that is machine learning. Now that I’m finally beginning to understand what’s going on, it’s a vast vast thing. I’m working on this small part of what machine learning is and now that I know what’s going on and how it works I'm actually really interested in this topic and I absolutely adore it. I’m absolutely going to pursue a career in machine learning, and it is all thanks to the research I've been doing on this campus.\n#oberlincollege #student #research #undergraduate #stem #machinelearning #computerscience", "org": "oberlinour"}

What most may not realize is that caffeine is classified as a psychoactive drug, specifically as a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant. Like any other drug, caffeine can provide many benefits. However, it is possible to ingest too much and feel negative side effects, though these are not long-term detrimental effects. What exactly are the effects of caffeine on the body? Similar to other CNS stimulants, caffeine increases one’s blood pressure, heart rate, and alertness. When taken in moderate amounts, such as drinking one cup of coffee or tea, caffeine can maximize post-exercise recovery and even help protect against neurodegenerative diseases and cancers.\"\n\nContinue reading in Issue 27 on our website.

Alvord grew up in a small town in New Mexico before studying social sciences at Dartmouth College. After graduating, she accepted a research position in New Mexico but was then encouraged to attend medical school. She enrolled at the University of New Mexico to complete her pre-med requirements, after which she applied to medical schools. Alvord was accepted into the Stanford University Medical School, received her M.D. in 1985, and achieved her board certification by 1994 as a surgeon, becoming the first Diné woman to do so. She returned to the Navajo reservation in New Mexico to work in the community, where she learned that although she was able to remedy people via surgery, it was not enough to fully heal a person from their ills and often lacked the spiritual and psychological aspects of healing as well. She learned from the healers of her tribe that she must have a holistic perspective of medicine and work with the patients themselves to fully heal a person from their illness. In her book “The Scalpel and the Silver Bear,” she writes about her experiences in combining Western medicine and traditional healing. OUR recognizes the amazing work of Lori Arviso Alvord and her contributions to medicine! \n#diversity #oberlin #OUR #research", "org": "oberlinour"}

It’s here where Red Baraat does what it does best - communing with their audience in a joyful, near hedonistic celebration of music and dance which, tellingly, draws a crowd even more diverse than the players on stage. The universality of what Red Baraat does is undeniable. And this is no happy accident. It is the product of intention and design. Says Jain, “The band…our songs…are addressing the multiplicity of viewpoints,” says Jain. “There’s ‘Zindabad,’ which means ‘Long Live’ in Hindi. In that song, we’re saying that we celebrate life, we celebrate devotion — but we also celebrate agitation and revolution. If we can unite people of all backgrounds and ethnicities to partake in the exuberance of life through the universal language of music, then life is that much sweeter.”", "org": "oberlin_solarity"}

In a world dominated by institutionalized white supremacy, memory is a key component of liberation. Theatre is how I create an institutional memory for my community, and one filled with joy and love as well as pain and perseverance. I am tired of seeing narratives about Black and Brown trans girls dying, about Black and Brown communities being assaulted in general. I wanted to create a real story about love between two people in a highly political world.” - Nani Borges ‘19\n📷 Julia Harbutt","org": "oberlin.theater"}

Here are the rules: \n\n1. Each player brings one wrapped gift to contribute to a common pool\n\n2. Players draw numbers to determine what order they will go in\n\n3. The first player selects a gift from the pool and opens it where everyone can see \n\n4. The following players can choose to either pick an unwrapped gift from the pool or steal a previous player’s gift. Anyone who gets their gift stolen in this way can do the same –choose a new gift or steal from someone else. \n\n5. After a gift is stolen twice, there will be a block on that gift and it can no longer be taken ! \n\n6. After all players have had a turn, the first player gets a chance to swap the gift he or she is holding for any other opened gift.  If they choose to end with their gift, the game is over, if they choose to swap, we continue swapping until someone concedes and sticks with their gift ! \n—-\nWe can’t wait to see you for a night of mischief and fun!

She contracted coronavirus disease 2019 back in April of 2020 and recounted her experience in an interview with Illinois Public Media. \nMayra went to the emergency room with low oxygen levels and was placed on a ventilator. What she thought would be a three-day stay turned into a six-week-long hell. She experienced nightmares, many involving her drowning, which she attributed to breathing difficulties. Mayra's family was told she might not even survive. But in June, the doctors suggested a life-saving measure: a double-lung transplant. Dr. Ankit Bharat, the Chief of Thoracic\nSurgery at Northwestern Medical, who operated on Mayra that month, said she was the sickest patient he has transplanted. Mayra was the first person to receive a double-lung transplant in the United States due to the virus. Since the operation, she is doing better but has to take various medications throughout the day to remain healthy. Mayra also faces at least a year of rehabilitation therapy before she can function independently.\"\n\nContinue reading in Issue 26 on our website.

During the day, these kittens live in the Ginko Gallery & Studio, where students and community members can visit and spend time with them, helping to socialize them. \n\n“That’s the only difference between a feral cat and a domestic cat, whether they’ve had a good experience with humans in that first eight weeks of their life,” Burgess said. “Otherwise, they’re basically a wild animal.” Click link in bio for more!\n\n📰Article by Sydney Collinger\n📷Photo credits: Eloise Rich","org": "ocreview"}

At the beginning of the fall semester, in my weekly calls with my mom, I found that weather reports were no longer a delightful neutral ground of discussion but the new cause of sulky pauses and exasperated sighs. This fire season, California experienced the largest, most destructive fire in the state’s history. As the president fails to address the root causes of the record-setting fires, just as he did with the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the United States (U.S.), I have directed my attention instead to the potential of bottom-up action by grassroots collectives and individuals to confront global crises. When the government does not provide clear guidance, what aids people in properly defending themselves and their community in the face of a global pandemic? Can this also be applied to help prompt action to prevent the destructive effects of climate change? \n\nContinue reading in Issue 26 on our website.

The first Posse Scholars from Houston will begin studies alongside the 19th Chicago cohort. \n\n“We are proud of our long and productive history with the Posse Foundation, and we will recruit Chicago Posse #18 this year,” Manuel Carballo, vice president and dean of Admissions and Financial Aid, wrote in an email to the Review. “We recruited our first Posse cohort in 2006 and have welcomed more than 170 Posse Scholars to campus since then. The Admissions Office works with a number of community-based organizations and programs that help us find amazing, talented students who might not otherwise be exposed to colleges like Oberlin.”\n\nThe College has received a $500,000, five-year grant that will help expand into Houston and strengthen Oberlin’s commitment to the program. This will allow for 10 students to be selected from both Houston and Chicago, with the process starting in December 2024. There are currently four Chicago Posse cohorts on campus, with the 18th group being recruited this year.

That is outside my knowledge, my abilities, and my capacity. I’m writing this to call attention to the fact that this war is truly a tragedy. I’m writing this so that we remember to check in on our friends, especially those with a close connection to the Israeli-Palestinian territory. I’m writing this to raise awareness of how this issue has polarized and disconnected the Oberlin community.\n\nIt has been a complex and difficult experience to exist as a Jewish person at Oberlin who strongly believes in and advocates for the freedom of the Palestinian people. I do not believe that complex and difficult experiences should be avoided. It is through this discomfort that we can all grow into the best versions of ourselves, able to hold nuanced and compassionate opinions.\n\nIn times of tragedy and loss, it is of the utmost importance that we support each other in our grief and acknowledge the collective suffering that we are experiencing. Oberlin is a community that emphasizes the importance of empathy and compassion as well as justice and activism. But have we been holding ourselves true to these ideals? I’ve noticed that some of the activism that has been happening on campus lately does not seem to come from a space of compassion, and it is certainly not leading to any justice.\n\n📰Article by Andy Roshal \n📷Photo credits: Eloise Rich", "org": "ocreview"}

So then, why does Oberlin seem to generate so many acclaimed reporters?\n\nJan Cooper, John C. Reid associate professor of Writing and Communication and English, put together the proposal for the JIC prior to fall 2019 alongside Professor of English and Cinema Studies Geoff Pingree, who acts as the JIC faculty advisor, and Professor of Hispanic Studies Sebastiaan Faber. Before the concentration was created, courses related to journalism included Journalism Basics, which Cooper herself currently teaches, Literary Journalism, presently taught by Visiting Associate Professor of Writing and Communication Hal Sundt, OC ’12, and a handful of first-year seminars.\n\nBeyond the College, Mike Telin, OC ’84, and Daniel Hathaway, both visiting teachers of Music Journalism, co-teach Introduction to Music Journalism in the Conservatory. The class, split about 50-50 between College and Conservatory students, boasts its own impressive repertoire of graduates working in journalism, from positions at NPR and The Boston Globe to social media manager at Carnegie Hall.\n\n📰Article by Eloise Rich\n📷Photo credits: Erin Koo", "org": "ocreview"}

Alvord grew up in a small town in New Mexico before studying social sciences at Dartmouth College. After graduating, she accepted a research position in New Mexico but was then encouraged to attend medical school. She enrolled at the University of New Mexico to complete her pre-med requirements, after which she applied to medical schools. Alvord was accepted into the Stanford University Medical School, received her M.D. in 1985, and achieved her board certification by 1994 as a surgeon, becoming the first Diné woman to do so. She returned to the Navajo reservation in New Mexico to work in the community, where she learned that although she was able to remedy people via surgery, it was not enough to fully heal a person from their ills and often lacked the spiritual and psychological aspects of healing as well. She learned from the healers of her tribe that she must have a holistic perspective of medicine and work with the patients themselves to fully heal a person from their illness. In her book “The Scalpel and the Silver Bear,” she writes about her experiences in combining Western medicine and traditional healing. OUR recognizes the amazing work of Lori Arviso Alvord and her contributions to medicine! \n#diversity #oberlin #OUR #research", "org": "oberlinour"}

They play a maverick combination of originals and covers that blur the lines between post-bop and rock.\n\nThe Bad Plus are the ultimate originals. A democratic unit with a clear vision and a refusal to conform to convention. For the past two decades they have played with spirit and adventure, made their own rules and done so with a bold sense of creativity and intent. Avoiding easy categorization, The Bad Plus has won critical acclaim and a legion of fans worldwide with their unique sound and flair for live performance.\nNow in their 21st year, The Bad Plus continues to push boundaries as founding members Reid Anderson (bass) and Dave King (drums) embark on a new piano-less incarnation of the band with Ben Monder (guitar) and Chris Speed (tenor saxophone) – instigating a new wave of excitement and anticipation within the band that is re-energizing their sound and inspiration. The Bad Plus have constantly searched to bridge genres and techniques while exploring the infinite possibilities of exceptional musicians working in perfect sync.\nThe Bad Plus is set to release their 15th studio recording and debut self-titled album as a dynamic new quartet via Edition Records on Friday, September 30th. “Evolution is necessary for life and creativity,” say Dave King and Reid Anderson. “We’ve evolved, but we’re still The Bad Plus.”", "org": "scoberlin"}

You have food science to thank for that! Food science currently offers us exciting innovations that continue to better the quality of what we eat. However, food science suffers from an internal conflict: do we eat to live, or live to eat? In terms of science and its application to food, this means distinguishing between using science to improve food as a pragmatic product (e.g., through advancements in food safety, nutrition, and yield) and using it to improve the consumer's aesthetic experience of food (e.g., through improving the sensory and psychological experiences). This dilemma has been reflected in the development of breakfast cereal. However, breakfast cereals can also show us that food's aesthetic and pragmatic qualities are not always separate; the future of food science may even rely on merging these qualities.

A few disorders have known initial triggers and modes of pathogenesis that have been well-defined but most remain a mystery. As a result of this void in autoimmune neuropathy research, public awareness is lacking, pharmaceutical development is stunted, and patients are left in vulnerable positions with few treatment options and very little information about their conditions or, for that matter, validation of their pain.\" Continue reading in Issue 23 on our website.

Tommy also directed “American Buffalo”, “The Visit”, “Waiting for Godot”, and was the co-director of an experimental troupe, /twelv/, with Max Truax ‘98. Tommy’s company, ArKtype, began in 2005 and produces experimental multi-disciplinary work with major venues and festivals worldwide. Collaborations include Peter Brook, Mikhail Baryshnikov, Big Dance Theater, John Cameron Mitchell, Bryce Dessner, Kaneza Schaal, Daniel Fish, Yael Farber, 600 Highwaymen, Sam Green, Julie Atlas Muz, nora chipaumire, CHRISTEENE, Penny Arcade, Ocean Vuong and many more. His Broadway debut ILLINOISE, a dance-theater adaptation of the Sufjan Stevens album by Jackie Sybblies Drury and Justin Peck, opens today at the St. James Theater and has already received Outer Critics and Drama League nominations, and he was shortlisted for an Oscar this year for Sam Green’s live cinema documentary 32 SOUNDS with JD Samson.\n\nTommy had this to say about his time doing theater at Oberlin: “As an environment Oberlin was all about pushing for a unique vision - all of my pursuits since have sought developmental paths unique to the work’s form. Caroline Jackson-Smith, Roger Copeland, and so many more lit up my world with essential languages of performance and their origins and that’s guided my approach every step of the way. All of our experiments were done with essential support from OSTA.”","org": "omta_osta"}

The reliable supplies found along the Nile, the Euphrates, and the Ganges, were critical to the development of civilization. Yet, humanity famously forsook this precious resource during the industrial age, when decades of wanton pollution and development destroyed wetlands and rivers. The United States was no different, but it received a wake-up call when a brand new movement started talking about the environment, yelling about a 1969 fire on the Cuyahoga River. In 1972, 366 House Representatives and 75 Senators declared that they would no longer ignore the necessity of safe water supplies, and the Clean Water Act passed with a bipartisan supermajority. In response to critics who questioned the government’s ability to afford the plan, the bill’s sponsor, Edmund Muskie, asked, 'Can we afford life itself?'\n\nContinue reading on our website in Issue 25!

In this contemporary absurdist play written by Jen Silverman, five women, all named Betty, are loosely linked by ties of acquaintanceship, friendship, and sexual interest, suffering from a rage they can barely name. Some make new friends, some discover new identities, and some fall in love – even with themselves – through the galvanizing power of “The Thea-Tah”.\n.\n.\nAlthough the department originally intended to produce Waiting for Godot by Samuel Beckett, a move halted by the Beckett Estate due to Oberlin’s all-female cast, Rivas found himself absolutely excited by all the women actors who showed up to auditions en masse.

This play dives right into that territory, puts us through a comic workout, and by the end, offers us a sense of hope.” What first appeared to be an obstacle soon turned into a fantastic opportunity for Oberlin to produce “Collective Rage”, a play specifically telling the stories of women for women written by a woman.

{"input": "Reflect on experiences with Oberlin's Gender, Sexuality, and Feminist Studies major", "output": "One of the reasons I was attracted to Oberlin was its Gender, Sexuality, and Feminist Studies major. I appreciated that I’d be able to explore my interest in gender studies, and valued the interdisciplinary and intersectional nature of the major, which aims to center issues of sexuality, queerness, and race within gender. As someone interested in the specific experiences of Black and queer women, this was very exciting to me. Unfortunately the major was not as intersectional as I had hoped.\n\nMy first semester at Oberlin, I enrolled in a course called Introduction to Gender, Sexuality, and Feminist Studies. I examined the syllabus with an excited eye. The readings were from many of my favorite authors and intellectuals like Angela Davis, Bell Hooks, and June Jordan, along with an array of authors whose work I had not been exposed to. Despite the diversity emphasized in the course readings, I attended the class and was surprised to find that I was one of a handful of students of color in attendance.\n\nOver time I quickly noticed the impact that the racial makeup of the class had on student-led discussions. While analyzing systems of oppression was expected in classroom discussions, many students who were not POC discussed America’s systems of oppression without race in mind. When referring to America’s power system, which subjugates Brown, Black, impoverished, and queer people, students harshly critiqued the system, rarely acknowledging their own participation and place in upholding the system they critiqued. I remember a particular white student who would often remark on the amusingly cringey things white people would do. Afterward, many other white students in the class would agree and remarked on their own experiences of “ridiculous things white people would say.” Click link in bio for more!\n\n📰Article by Avery Russell \n📷Photo credits: Abe Frato", "org": "ocreview"}

Theatre is different there it is bold and experimental, and passionate. Seeing plays in another language showsus how we tell the story without words.

When creating work now, it is helpful to remember that and make sure to tell the story without leaning on language.

{"input": "Promotional post for Oberlin Djembe Orchestra","output": "The Oberlin Djembe Orchestra, created by Visiting Instructor of West African Drumming Weedie Braimah in the fall of last year, asks students to reshape their understanding of music. Braimah, a Grammy-nominated djembefola, offers a window into West African culture in his course. Braimah, who was born in Ghana and grew up in St. Louis, is not a percussionist — he plays only one instrument. His work collaborating with artists and teaching has aided in keeping the djembe tradition alive.\n\n“One of the first things Braimah] tells us is that if you’re coming to this class to be in a drum circle or improve your rhythm and beat counting, this class is not for you,” College fourth-year Chudi Martin Jr., who has been playing with the Djembe Orchestra since its inception, said. “The expectations, demands, and needs of this course are going to be drastically different.”\n\nMany believe the origins of the djembe can be traced back to the 12th Century. Historians generally credit blacksmiths in the Malinke tribe of modern-day Mali for stretching the first rawhide across a djembe. As the empire of Mali expanded, and people migrated to modern-day Senegal, Mauritania, Guinea, and beyond, djembe music evolved and diversified. According to their descendants, the word djembe comes from the saying, “anke djé, anke be,” which means “everyone gather together in peace.” This also defines the djembe’s main purpose.\n\n📰Article by Nicolas Stebbins\n📷Photo credits: Erin Koo","org": "ocreview"}

While teaching, she studied the compounds of chaulmoogra oil and was able to derive its healing compounds into an injectable form that would alleviate the symptoms of leprosy. Recently after discovering this treatment, however, Ball passed away from accidentally inhaling chlorine gas and was not able to see the extent of her discovery. Furthermore, credit for her discovery was stolen, and it was not until recently that the first treatment for Hansen’s disease was credited to her.

The celebrations continued year after year.\n.\n.\n It’s important to note that, Juneteenth isn’t a straightforward story of emancipation, nor did it necessarily improve conditions for many African Americans the next day or even the next decade. \n  Erin Stewart Mauldin said “Juneteenth is neither the beginning nor the end of something. The end of the Civil War and the ending of slavery didn’t happen overnight and was a lot more like a jagged edge than a clean cut.”\n.\n.\nOn that note, do your own research on Juneteenth and learn the history. Don’t forget to come out tomorrow, June 18th for the Juneteenth block party with ABUSUA! \n\nSource: \nhttps://www.stpetersburg.usf.edu/news/2021/juneteenth-complicated-history-significance-celebration-around-struggle-for-freedom.aspx", "org": "oberlinabusua"}

The firm claimed to have acquired them from computer drives that were maintained and accessed by several University of Michigan coaches. Soon after, the Big Ten opened a sign-stealing investigation into Michigan, with Michigan staffer Connor Stalions being the ringleader of the operation.\n\nStalions was originally a volunteer assistant in 2015, but officially became part of their staff in 2022. A Michigan native, his parents both went to University of Michigan. Stalions played football throughout his childhood and his dad was a football coach for an eighth grade team. He graduated from the Naval academy in 2017, where he worked as a volunteer football assistant during his undergraduate years. He also wrote a 550–600 page document called the Michigan Manifesto that he managed daily, which outlined his 15-year blueprint for taking over the University of Michigan Football program and becoming head coach. Stalions is suspended with pay from his role for the Wolverines due to sign-stealing allegations.\n\n📰Article by Andrea Nguyen and Micah Rodriguez\n📷Photo courtesy of Norm Hall","org": "ocreview"}

I really value the way my time abroad in Moscow supplemented my approach to acting, and my history major has been deeply skewed towards Eastern Europe and specifically Russia. This play allows me to wrap all of that together with everything I’ve learned from the theater faculty. ‘A Warsaw Melody’ is such an ensemble piece, I’ve loved working with Connor, he’s so committed and earnestly connected to the work, and Christine and I have taken (truly) every acting class together short of 100 our freshman year, so it’s really easy for us to communicate about the process. The play is cinematic and thoughtful and really wistfully beautiful; a perfect capture of love in the Soviet Union.- Casey Labbate ‘20 •\n•\n•\n#OberlinCollege #OberlinCollegeTheater", "org": "oberlin.theater"}

The workshop will also discuss farm labor issues such as worker abuse, racism, labor movements (UFW), ways for OSCAns to support, and more. \n\nPlease join us for this workshop in Peters 104, grab some dinner, then head over to eL-House! 😌✨\n\nBonchinche chill sesh this Sunday April 2nd! 3-5 PM in @oc_latinxhouse ‼️ Please join us if you can, we hope this event will serve as a safe space for Latinx students to express anything that might be pressing, interesting, and/or beneficial for the Latinx community to know! 💜💜", "org": "oc_laalianzalatinx"}

Doing geology research in context to building computer programs allowed me to develop a deeper understanding of both fields. Once I figured out what I wanted to do with my life I started looking into graduate school programs for geology, something that as a computer science major I didn't really have to do because it’s a little easier to get a job in. What’s really unique about research at Oberlin as an undergrad is that  we have a small team so we go out and collect the samples that we want. At other institutions it’s just a lot of research without the field work experience and I think the field work experience is one of the most valuable parts of geology. Having research experience prior to my first year helped me navigate my first year, it taught me to pick apart big projects, how to work as a team and that I was able to rely on other people and not just myself.\n\n𝑾𝒉𝒂𝒕 𝒊𝒔 𝒔𝒐𝒎𝒆𝒕𝒉𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝒊𝒎𝒑𝒐𝒓𝒕𝒂𝒏𝒕 𝒚𝒐𝒖 𝒉𝒂𝒗𝒆 𝒍𝒆𝒂𝒓𝒏𝒆𝒅 𝒇𝒓𝒐𝒎 𝒚𝒐𝒖𝒓 𝒎𝒆𝒏𝒕𝒐𝒓?\nAmanda has taught me many things.

She gives me the freedom to finish my task at my own pace. She believes in my ability to get things done and she’s constantly reassuring me that I’m doing good.

The important work of M4BL, the #metoo movement, an increasing awareness of the breadth of gender identities and Queer folks in our culture, and centuries overdue justice for Black, Indigenous, and People of Color, all REQUIRE that movement forward in this time reflect a genuine commitment to social justice. These questions arise in every area of what we do. Whether it's a question of programming plays that reflect the breadth of who we are, or how to create safe places in which to make our work without replicating the trauma we seek to expose and eradicate, our conscious effort must forever be to MAKE the world we wish to occupy.\n\nThis panel discussion will focus on a case study. Even as the #metoo movement was first signalling the urgency of protections for Women and Femme identities, and as Black Lives Matter was raising awareness of gross injustices, several members of the Cleveland Theater Community began to assemble a model for working: The CLEan House Document. In the midst of its roll-out, the pandemic forced closure of theaters across the greater Cleveland area.

Formula 1 is one of the world’s premier open-wheel racing leagues, in which 10 teams compete with two cars and two drivers per team. The competition travels around the globe to different tracks where the races, called Grand Prix, are held. The driver with the most points, earned from their finishing position in the race, is crowned the Drivers’ World Champion at the end of the season, and the team with the most points, earned from the combined finishing position of both cars, is crowned the Constructors’ World Champion.\n\nThe finale in Abu Dhabi put an end to a season that saw many longstanding records shattered, a third Drivers’ Championship for Dutch driver Max Verstappen, and a sixth Constructors’ Championship for his team, Red Bull Racing. \n\nThe combination of Verstappen and Red Bull’s RB-19 car proved dominant throughout the year. The Dutch driver claimed 19 wins out of the 22 races this season, with his Red Bull teammate Sergio Perez claiming two, bringing the team’s total to 21 wins. The only race Red Bull lost was the Singapore Grand Prix, where Ferrari’s Carlos Sainz became the sole non-Red Bull driver to stand atop the podium.\n\n📰Article by Karthik Ranganadhan\n📷Photo credits: Erin Koo", "org": "ocreview"}

On a societal level, racism has led to inequalities that permeate all spheres of life, from education to incarceration. Sparked by the deaths of Ahmad Arbery, Breonna Taylor, George Floyd, and countless other individuals, many have began to rise up against the systemic racism that pervades our society. This new wave of activism and the resurgence of the Black Lives Matter movement was brought on by police brutality, the unjust murder of Black people, and increased national attention on the experience of African Americans within our society. News and social media can help us see the effects of racism on individuals and groups, but it can be harder to tell how racism affects people on a microscopic level, at their individual biological experience. Does racism actually affect people at their biological core?\"\n\nContinue reading in Issue 26 on our website.

(Actually, my first experience with this play, The Misanthrope, was through a recorded audio performance that I found in my town’s public library—in my far-gone youth!) The great positive of performing this play this semester is that our actors—a truly wonderful ensemble drawn from all three on-campus classes—must focus on performing with their voices, still using all the tools of a fine actor to get to the ultimate expression of their characters, but in an audio world.”\n\nAnd, don’t worry, it’s not too late to register.

She graduated from her high school class as valedictorian and received a full ride to Virginia State University. She graduated from college in 1952 with a degree in mathematics. She then taught math and science courses before returning to Virginia State to complete a Masters of Mathematics in 1955. After graduating, West was hired to work at the Naval Proving Ground, located in Dahlgren, Virginia. During her early time there, she was involved as a computer programmer and managed data processing systems. West was one of the only Black employees, and was the second Black woman to work there. Simultaneously, she earned a second master’s in public administration. In 1960, West participated in groundbreaking research that proved Pluto’s motion relative to Neptune’s. After this, she began working with data from satellites. In the 1980s, West programmed calculations to model the shape of the Earth. Her designs were the basis of the modern GPS system. She retired in 1998, and received a PhD in public administration after retiring. She was inducted into the US Air Force Hall of Fame in 2018. OUR honors the great work that Gladys West has done, and the dedication she demonstrated to her field. #OUR #research #oberlin #diversity", "org": "oberlinour"}
