Abstract: Artificial intelligence (psychology) is the study of how to make computers do things that require intelligence when done by humans. It is related to the similar task of using computers to understand human intelligence, but AI does not have to confine itself to methods that are biologically observable or psychologically credible; it can draw on mathematical modeling, computer science, and engineering ingenuity to develop intelligent behavior in oblivious systems. Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence concerned with the design and development of algorithms that allow machines to learn from data and improve their performance over time. ML algorithms are used for tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, and

Boba is a popular drink among international students at the University of Oregon, and it’s not hard to see why! This delicious beverage combines chewy tapioca pearls with sweet syrup and milk or tea for a refreshing and satisfying treat. For many international students, boba is morethan just a drink; it’s a cultural experience that connects them to their home countries and creates a sense of community with other international students on campus. Whether enjoying boba with friends or sipping on a cup while studying, this beloved drink brings a touch of international flavor to life in Eugene! 🍵🌍🌟 International student and scholar service (ISSS) staff members love bonding over boba with their international student clients. It's a great way to connect over shared culture and enjoy a delicious treat together! 🌟🥛👩‍🎓🌐 #internationalstudentlife #bobatea #culturalconnection #ISSS #UpsideDownWorld #InternationalStudentAndScholarService #GlobalCommunity #TasteTheWorld #BobaLove 🌟🍽

Pizza at 1PM Monday, then a trip to the zscaler office for some networking.

I’ve been meaning to get out and see more of the city since moving here in January. I’m not sure why it took me so long to do this, but better late then never!

The pizza was delicious and the company was great. We chatted about all sorts of things from work to life outside the office. It was nice to catch up with everyone over a slice or two (or three).

After lunch we headed off to the zscaler office where we met up with some colleagues for some networking fun. The atmosphere was buzzing as people mingled and caught up on what’s new in their lives.

Overall it was an enjoyable day filled with good food, friendly faces, and plenty of conversation. Looking forward to doing it again soon! 🍕🌟 Networking with friends at zscaler office #pizzaparty #networkingfun #friendshipgoals

This delicious beverage combines chewy tapioca pearls with sweet syrup and milk or tea for a refreshing and satisfying treat. For many international students, boba is more than just a drink; it’s a cultural experience that connects them to their home country and helps them feel at home in the United States.

One student from China shared, “Boba reminds me of my hometown in China where there are so many boba shops. It brings back happy memories and makes me feel connected to my culture even though I am far away.” Another student from Japan added, “Boba is such a comfort food for me. When I feel homesick, I love going to a boba shop and ordering my favorite flavor with extra tapioca pearls!”

International students often gather at local boba shops to socialize and make new friends. These shops provide a welcoming space for international students to connect with each other over a cup of boba while enjoying the familiar flavors of home.

For international students, boba is much more than just a drink – it

The blood drive was a huge success! With the help of generous donors and the hard work of volunteers, we were able to collect a record-breaking amount of blood. The blood drive took place at Wilder Hall and was open to the public from 2pm to 6pm. Donors were greeted with warm smiles and given the opportunity to save lives with their selfless act of donating blood.

The blood drive was organized by a local nonprofit organization that works to promote blood donation and raise awareness about the importance of giving back to the community. The organization's mission is to ensure that there is always enough blood available for those in need, whether it be for emergency transfusions or routine medical procedures.

Throughout the day, donors lined up to give blood and make a difference in someone's life. VolunteersINFUSED WITH PASSION AND DEDICATION provided support and guidance to donors, ensuring that the process went smoothly and that everyone felt comfortable and safe.

At the end of the day, the organizersINSPIRED BY COMPASSION AND SELissued certificates of appreciation to all donors as a token of gratitude for their generosity. They also
