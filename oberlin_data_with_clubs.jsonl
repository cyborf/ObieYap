That figure has been closer to 2% for the past 20 years, but there are signs that we are entering a period of higher inflation as the economy recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nLuckily, there are strategies to combat inflation. Retaining some exposure to stocks in your investment portfolio is one popular strategy because equity prices rise with inflation and tend to grow over time. In your fixed income portfolio, you can also consider using Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, whose value and interest payments adjust with inflation. - Motley Fool\n\nWe will be unpacking this on Monday, see you there\u2728", "org": "oberlinwnbfinance"}

In addition to the Outings Club, I am a member of OSCA and the Pottery Co-op, and\u00a0 volunteer in the Biology Department's Herbarium (I love plants!!!). I will be leading a 4-day backpacking trip to Zaleski State Forest, which is located in the Appalachian foothills of southern Ohio. In addition to the main backpacking loop we will do at Zaleski, there are a couple State Nature Preserves we will explore on the way there and back--namely Lake Katharine and Conkles Hollow.\n\nI intend for this trip to be as accessible and educational as possible, whether this is your first time backpacking, or if you want to learn more about the ecology and geology of Ohio! Spring is rapidly approaching (in spite of the snow), especially the further south you go, so I'm hoping we'll see some cool wildflowers. Hiking should be of moderate difficulty, and we won't be doing more than ~5 miles on any given day. This will give us more time to relax at camp, make good food, and have fun!

Sarah Krohn is opening.\n\nA key player in the new wave of contemporary folk singers, Olive Klug is an independent singer/songwriter with a rare vocal gift. Self-styled after genre icons like Joni Mitchell and Brandi Carlile, Olive is known for their beautiful tone and vividly honest storytelling. Their sound is reminiscent of the Golden Age of American Folk Music, but with a uniquely modern lyrical sensibility.  Following the success of their Tiktok video previews, Olive released a series of new singles in the Spring and Summer of 2021. These songs chronicle Olive's struggle to make sense of a senseless world and reflects their experience with queer identity, ambivalence in romantic relationships, and the struggle to establish adulthood in unprecedented times. Olive released their single \"Self Help\" on February 4, 2022, a bittersweet tear-jerker about personal growth that received critical acclaim from multiple press outlets.", "org": "thecatinthecream"}

In readings, discussions, research and performance of scenes in class, we observe changes in voice, style and narrative in American theatrical writing.  As the end of the 20th century approached, how did these playwrights read their changing times, calculate the weight of history and invent new forms of expression?

The important work of M4BL, the #metoo movement, an increasing awareness of the breadth of gender identities and Queer folks in our culture, and centuries overdue justice for Black, Indigenous, and People of Color, all REQUIRE that movement forward in this time reflect a genuine commitment to social justice. These questions arise in every area of what we do. Whether it's a question of programming plays that reflect the breadth of who we are, or how to create safe places in which to make our work without replicating the trauma we seek to expose and eradicate, our conscious effort must forever be to MAKE the world we wish to occupy.\n\nThis panel discussion will focus on a case study. Even as the #metoo movement was first signalling the urgency of protections for Women and Femme identities, and as Black Lives Matter was raising awareness of gross injustices, several members of the Cleveland Theater Community began to assemble a model for working: The CLEan House Document. In the midst of its roll-out, the pandemic forced closure of theaters across the greater Cleveland area.

In an unprecedented run of promiscuity in the span of only a week, Ty manages to impregnate three women: his ex- girlfriend, his 40-something, married next-door neighbor, and his 18-year-old student. \"All This Intimacy\" distinctly attracted Bowman because of the comedy\u2019s absolute absurdity.

This year for the Winter Term MainStage the department produced \u201cCollective Rage\u201d!\n.\n.\nWe were lucky enough to have Carnegie Mellon Presidential Postdoctoral Fellow Tlaloc Rivas guest direct \u201cCollective Rage\u201d, also known as \u201cCollective Rage: A Play in Five Betties; in essence, A Queer And Occasionally Hazardous Exploration; Do You Remember When You Were In Middle School And You Read About Shackleton And How He Explored The Antarctic?; Imagine The Antarctic As A Pussy And It\u2019s Sort Of Like That\u201d. In this contemporary absurdist play written by Jen Silverman, five women, all named Betty, are loosely linked by ties of acquaintanceship, friendship, and sexual interest, suffering from a rage they can barely name. Some make new friends, some discover new identities, and some fall in love \u2013 even with themselves \u2013 through the galvanizing power of \u201cThe Thea-Tah\u201d.\n.\n.\nAlthough the department originally intended to produce Waiting for Godot by Samuel Beckett, a move halted by the Beckett Estate due to Oberlin\u2019s all-female cast, Rivas found himself absolutely excited by all the women actors who showed up to auditions en masse. Rivas elaborates, \u201cRight at this moment, our cultural conversations about identities and relationships are expanding faster than they ever have before. This play dives right into that territory, puts us through a comic workout, and by the end, offers us a sense of hope.\u201d What first appeared to be an obstacle soon turned into a fantastic opportunity for Oberlin to produce \u201cCollective Rage\u201d, a play specifically telling the stories of women for women written by a woman. As Rivas resoundingly states, \u201cAs a director of color I\u2019m delighted to work with a multi-ethnic cast, and since I\u2019m one of the only men in the room, I\u2019m honored to hold some space for women\u2019s voices \u2013 including the playwright\u2019s \u2013 to be heard.\u201d\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#OberlinCollege #OberlinCollegeTheater", "org": "oberlin.theater"}

Using Shakespeare\u2019s original text, translated German Art Song, and modern mediums, Marina Wright\u2019s \u201820 one-woman show, \u201cBut Never Doubt I Love\u201d, reconsidered one of Shakespeare\u2019s most famous characters: Hamlet. It began with Wright, as Hamlet, in the middle of crisis: coping with the loss of his father, trying to comprehend his mother\u2019s lack of faithfulness, and grappling with his uncle\u2019s rise to the throne. Hamlet\u2019s inner and outer worlds are in turmoil. The show effectively investigated Hamlet\u2019s mental state, exploring how both anxiety and depression affect him and his relationship to the women in his life.\n\nExcellently balancing her classical vocal training from the Conservatory and her Shakespearean technique gained through the Theater Department, Wright\u2019s one-woman show, \u201cBut Never Doubt I Love\u201d, was the perfect culmination of Wright\u2019s 5 years here at Oberlin.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#OberlinTheater\u00a0#OberlinCollege", "org": "oberlin.theater"}

For many artists, creating a play is mostly about this process\u2014the greatest fulfillment can come from working, sharing and living with the sense of community that such a very particular group endeavor generates. And because of a fateful surprise, the cast and creators of our spring production of \"Peter and the Starcatcher\" have been allowed only that satisfaction, thanks to the sharp, final blow from Covid-19 that stopped production in its tracks, just as the process was really taking off in a big way. \nBut rather than lamenting the exuberant thrill of sharing our performances with an audience, it\u2019s my hope that everyone involved in Starcatcher has come away with a deep satisfaction in the work they did, the fun they had and the beauty of the process of working together to create some good art. You all deserve that gratification. I\u2019m proud and delighted to have shared that experience with every one of you! \nI want to thank and thank again every member of that well-oiled ensemble, a prodigiously talented team: my design and production colleagues and administrative buddies, the show\u2019s execution crews, Cass and her fantastic stage management team, Tempest, Lauren and Joey, and certainly the great ensemble of actors who played hard, worked brilliantly\u2014and hey, tumbled through a run before the end!\u201d", "org": "oberlin.theater"}

This play allows me to wrap all of that together with everything I\u2019ve learned from the theater faculty. \u2018A Warsaw Melody\u2019 is such an ensemble piece, I\u2019ve loved working with Connor, he\u2019s so committed and earnestly connected to the work, and Christine and I have taken (truly) every acting class together short of 100 our freshman year, so it\u2019s really easy for us to communicate about the process.

(Actually, my first experience with this play, The Misanthrope, was through a recorded audio performance that I found in my town\u2019s public library\u2014in my far-gone youth!) The great positive of performing this play this semester is that our actors\u2014a truly wonderful ensemble drawn from all three on-campus classes\u2014must focus on performing with their voices, still using all the tools of a fine actor to get to the ultimate expression of their characters, but in an audio world.\u201d\n\nAnd, don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not too late to register.

An area that looked and felt different from the rest of their rooms so it was easy to distinguish between a work environment and a home environment. \n\nIn order to achieve that each space, regardless of if they share some characteristics, is unique in layout and setup, and a lot of the time have been expanded with items from the dancers personal collections. Each set and costume is inspired by the dancer's unique characters they created with the lighting and color pallete acting as a unifying element.\u201c\n\nTo see more of Homer-Drummond\u2019s initial design concepts, head over to @bigbadspender.\n\nSeen above: a collage of the initial design board for Big Spender\u2019s costume design.\n\nYou can register NOW to see Big Spender which will be available to watch February 19 - 21 at the link in our bio.", "org": "oberlin.theater"}

As the year begins to wrap up we encourage our POC community to join us in reflecting on the past few years, and the future at Oberlin; specifically, how we can maintain the work we\u2019re doing within our orgs, leadership positions, etc, while engaging in student activism and preserving institutional memory. \n\nIn this clip Maca reads part of the original proposal previous LAL board members presented to the office of ResLife in hopes of establishing a Latinx, identity-based dorm. In the spirit of institutional memory we decided to share here as not many know about how this space came to be. Next year will mark the 4th year of Latinx Heritage House\u2019s existence, proof that student activist efforts WORK and can achieve what might seem impossible!!

Although most cannot go out and protest due to various reasons, many have taken to social media to share resources, donation links, and petitions for the greater community. We urge our non-Black community members to hold difficult conversations with their family members about the anti-Blackness that persists in many of our families, resulting in the erasure of Afro-Latinx individuals.

As a board we presented on the history of D\u00eda de Los Muertos including its origins in indigenous communities and how their traditions have survived and transcended Spanish colonialism. We are so touched by everyone who shared with us about their loved ones and we are grateful we were able to help create a space for love, grief, and community for those who traditionally celebrate and those who do not. We hope to continue to make efforts and strides towards community building in relation to Latinidad identity and the intersectionality that is embedded within our culture. Because it is beautiful. Because it is ours to claim. Because it is something to be proud of.

Consent violations or emotional betrayal can shatter your sense of normalcy and leave you reeling from the traumatic backlash. It is normal to experience anger in response to traumatic events.\n\nYet we often fear or avoid anger because of its perceived destructive effects. We throw around statements like, \u201churt people hurt people,\u201d as though it\u2019s a given that anger stemming from hurt will harm those around us. If you watched parents express anger with violence or abuse, you\u2019re more likely to be primed to believe that anger is unacceptable.

Impacts of sexual violence: Disconnect with spirit, culture, or self. Physical injury - lasting short or long term. Trauma, hyper-vigilance, flashbacks. Difficulty trusting or believing others. Entire medicine wheel: spiritual, physical, emotional, mental. \n\n2) Sexual violence is pervasive. American Indians are 2.5 times more likely to experience sexual assault compared to all other races. 34% of Native women are raped in their lifetimes. At least 84% of perpetrators of these crimes are non-Native men. \n\n3) Sexual violence and trauma. Following an assault, common outcomes include poor mental health (PTSD, acute stress disorders, depression, sleep disorders, anxiety, suicidal ideation). Decreased sexual urges/pleasure, increased sexual risk behaviors, substance use and physical health problems. Revitalization (is) also commonly reported for Indigenous survivors of childhood sexual abuse. \n\n4) Sexual Violence is Preventable.

A democratic unit with a clear vision and a refusal to conform to convention. For the past two decades they have played with spirit and adventure, made their own rules and done so with a bold sense of creativity and intent. Avoiding easy categorization, The Bad Plus has won critical acclaim and a legion of fans worldwide with their unique sound and flair for live performance.\nNow in their 21st year, The Bad Plus continues to push boundaries as founding members Reid Anderson (bass) and Dave King (drums) embark on a new piano-less incarnation of the band with Ben Monder (guitar) and Chris Speed (tenor saxophone) \u2013 instigating a new wave of excitement and anticipation within the band that is re-energizing their sound and inspiration. The Bad Plus have constantly searched to bridge genres and techniques while exploring the infinite possibilities of exceptional musicians working in perfect sync.\nThe Bad Plus is set to release their 15th studio recording and debut self-titled album as a dynamic new quartet via Edition Records on Friday, September 30th. \u201cEvolution is necessary for life and creativity,\u201d say Dave King and Reid Anderson. \u201cWe\u2019ve evolved, but we\u2019re still The Bad Plus.\u201d", "org": "scoberlin"}

Bejar's music is fluid, as prone to the sumptuous textures of yacht-rock as it is to prickly guitar ballads.

It is our belief that Black students and community members are entitled to feel safe and welcome at the \u2018Sco, and we must take every possible step to realize this right. \nTherefore, we unequivocally reject the cultures of racial segregation, exclusion, and erasure that have plagued The \u2018Sco in the past. No longer will we accept the conditions that produce exclusively white crowds at events; no longer will we ignore the conditions that allow sexual and racial violence to exist within or because of our space; no longer will we prioritize silence over the centering and elevation of marginalized voices. \nWe recognize that the \u2018Sco can become a truly inclusive environment, but only after it is made safe and comfortable for EVERY member of the Black community. Ultimately, we challenge all non-Black members of our community to actively engage in the fight to realize the full potential of our space. As we work through this process, we must each reflect on our relationship to both The \u2018Sco and the broader community. In doing so, we will learn from our mistakes and hold one another accountable in the future. \nWe need to reconcile ourselves if we are to be who we claim, and we need to be who we claim if we are to survive and love.

Ocampo-Friedmann was born in Manila, Philippines and obtained a degree in botany from the University of the Philippines in 1958. She then completed her master\u2019s at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem before returning to the Philippines to work. In 1973, she obtained a PhD at Florida State University. Ocampo-Friedmann and her husband often traveled to conduct research on algae and microorganisms. In particular, their trip to the Dry Valleys located in Antarctica was groundbreaking. The Dry Valleys are devoid of ice and snow and are characterized by their low humidity, so when the couple found microorganisms, now known as cryptoendoliths, living within the rock under extreme conditions, this discovery has implications for life in extreme environments. The couple successfully grew a culture of these microorganisms in a laboratory, and after writing a paper highlighting their discovery, their research supported the theory of the possibility of life on Mars.

{"input": "TO BE COMPLETED", "output": "This week, OUR is celebrating the legacy of the American mathematician, Gladys West. West was born in Sutherland, Virginia in 1930. She graduated from her high school class as valedictorian and received a full ride to Virginia State University. She graduated from college in 1952 with a degree in mathematics. She then taught math and science courses before returning to Virginia State to complete a Masters of Mathematics in 1955. After graduating, West was hired to work at the Naval Proving Ground, located in Dahlgren, Virginia. During her early time there, she was involved as a computer programmer and managed data processing systems. West was one of the only Black employees, and was the second Black woman to work there. Simultaneously, she earned a second master\u2019s in public administration. In 1960, West participated in groundbreaking research that proved Pluto\u2019s motion relative to Neptune\u2019s. After this, she began working with data from satellites. In the 1980s, West programmed calculations to model the shape of the Earth. Her designs were the basis of the modern GPS system. She retired in 1998, and received a PhD in public administration after retiring. She was inducted into the US Air Force Hall of Fame in 2018. OUR honors the great work that Gladys West has done, and the dedication she demonstrated to her field. #OUR #research #oberlin #diversity", "org": "oberlinour"}

At 19, hooks began writing her book \"Ain't I a Woman\", published a decade later. bell hooks continued her higher education and eventually obtained a doctorate in English literature at the University of California, Santa Cruz. After that, she began her teaching career, which she considered to be the most powerful form of political resistance. Some of the schools she instructed were the University of Southern California, Yale University, and Oberlin College. Throughout her life, bell hooks wrote over 30 books and many scholarly articles before passing away on December 15, 2021.

{"input": "TO BE COMPLETED", "output": "Happy AAPI month! Today\u2019s featured researcher is Peter Tsai, a Taiwanese American material scientist who invented the N95 respirator. Originally from Taiwan, Tsai traveled to the United States in 1981 for his postgraduate studies at the University of Tennessee. He then earned his postgraduate degree in materials science as well as completing over 500 credits in math, physics, and chemistry. Tsai became a professor at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, while conducting research at the same time. In particular, he was attempting to develop a material that would filter air through electrostatically fibers. Eventually, this fiber would create the N95 mask, whose original intent was to filter out dust or other microparticles used in construction, but in 1996 the US Centers for Disease and Control discovered that these masks could also be used to protect people from viruses as well. Peter Tsai entered retirement in 2019, but came out of retirement in 2020, during the midst of the pandemic, to resolve the problem of the depletion of N95 masks. Tsai was able to devise a way to reuse the masks without compromising their protective qualities. Through his invention of the N95 mask, Peter Tsai was able to save millions of lives from harmful particles and diseases.

I started my research during the first week of July. I knew I wanted to do research when I was in the process of applying to colleges. After that, I knew I wanted to do research on people from marginalized communities , particularly ethnic minority elementary students from low income backgrounds. I wanted to do research on these groups to see what resources they are lacking compared to their more affluent counterparts and see what resources and intervention can we implement. Working in Professor Wilson\u2019s lab has allowed me to start accomplishing this goal. \n\ud835\udc7e\ud835\udc89\ud835\udc82\ud835\udc95 \ud835\udc8c\ud835\udc8a\ud835\udc8f\ud835\udc85 \ud835\udc90\ud835\udc87 \ud835\udc93\ud835\udc86\ud835\udc94\ud835\udc86\ud835\udc82\ud835\udc93\ud835\udc84\ud835\udc89 \ud835\udc82\ud835\udc93\ud835\udc86 \ud835\udc9a\ud835\udc90\ud835\udc96 \ud835\udc85\ud835\udc90\ud835\udc8a\ud835\udc8f\ud835\udc88? I\u2019m looking at the correlation between the teacher-student relationship and student academic performance, as well as the correlation between being liked by peers and student academic performance. The data set I am working with is composed of predominantly Black, low-income students. Which is the population I am deeply interested in helping. I\u2019m also analyzing it by grade level and gender. The goal is to find significant developmental markers among ethnic minority children in this respect.\n\ud835\udc6f\ud835\udc90\ud835\udc98 \ud835\udc89\ud835\udc82\ud835\udc94 \ud835\udc95\ud835\udc89\ud835\udc8a\ud835\udc94 \ud835\udc93\ud835\udc86\ud835\udc94\ud835\udc86\ud835\udc82\ud835\udc93\ud835\udc84\ud835\udc89 \ud835\udc94\ud835\udc89\ud835\udc82\ud835\udc91\ud835\udc86\ud835\udc85 \ud835\udc9a\ud835\udc90\ud835\udc96\ud835\udc93 \ud835\udc86\ud835\udc85\ud835\udc96\ud835\udc84\ud835\udc82\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc8a\ud835\udc90\ud835\udc8f?

{"input": "TO BE COMPLETED", "output": "This week, OUR is honoring American biochemist Marie M. Daly. Born in 1921, Daly was the first Black woman to earn a Ph.D. in chemistry in the United States. Daly grew up in New York, where she graduated magna cum laude from Queens College in 1942. Daly earned her master\u2019s at New York University and her PhD Columbia University. After graduating, Daly began work as a science instructor at Howard University, while also conducting research on the cell nucleus. Daly then began work as an assistant professor of biochemistry at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. During her time there, not only was she an esteemed researcher, but she also was dedicated to increasing the minority enrollment at the college. Daly's research on histones is now considered to be fundamental to the field of biochemisty, and her work on protein synthesis was crucial in the discovery on DNA. After retiring from Albert Einstein College, Daly initiated a scholarship at Queens College for Black students to pursue chemistry and physics in memory of her father. OUR celebrates Marie Daly's salient work in biochemistry and also her dedication to giving underrepresented students opportunities in STEM. #diversity #OUR #oberlin #research", "org": "oberlinour"}

Alvord grew up in a small town in New Mexico before studying social sciences at Dartmouth College. After graduating, she accepted a research position in New Mexico but was then encouraged to attend medical school. She enrolled at the University of New Mexico to complete her pre-med requirements, after which she applied to medical schools. Alvord was accepted into the Stanford University Medical School, received her M.D. in 1985, and achieved her board certification by 1994 as a surgeon, becoming the first Din\u00e9 woman to do so. She returned to the Navajo reservation in New Mexico to work in the community, where she learned that although she was able to remedy people via surgery, it was not enough to fully heal a person from their ills and often lacked the spiritual and psychological aspects of healing as well. She learned from the healers of her tribe that she must have a holistic perspective of medicine and work with the patients themselves to fully heal a person from their illness. In her book \u201cThe Scalpel and the Silver Bear,\u201d she writes about her experiences in combining Western medicine and traditional healing.

Doing geology research in context to building computer programs allowed me to develop a deeper understanding of both fields. Once I figured out what I wanted to do with my life I started looking into graduate school programs for geology, something that as a computer science major I didn't really have to do because it\u2019s a little easier to get a job in. What\u2019s really unique about research at Oberlin as an undergrad is that  we have a small team so we go out and collect the samples that we want. At other institutions it\u2019s just a lot of research without the field work experience and I think the field work experience is one of the most valuable parts of geology. Having research experience prior to my first year helped me navigate my first year, it taught me to pick apart big projects, how to work as a team and that I was able to rely on other people and not just myself.\n\n\ud835\udc7e\ud835\udc89\ud835\udc82\ud835\udc95 \ud835\udc8a\ud835\udc94 \ud835\udc94\ud835\udc90\ud835\udc8e\ud835\udc86\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc89\ud835\udc8a\ud835\udc8f\ud835\udc88 \ud835\udc8a\ud835\udc8e\ud835\udc91\ud835\udc90\ud835\udc93\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc82\ud835\udc8f\ud835\udc95 \ud835\udc9a\ud835\udc90\ud835\udc96 \ud835\udc89\ud835\udc82\ud835\udc97\ud835\udc86 \ud835\udc8d\ud835\udc86\ud835\udc82\ud835\udc93\ud835\udc8f\ud835\udc86\ud835\udc85 \ud835\udc87\ud835\udc93\ud835\udc90\ud835\udc8e \ud835\udc9a\ud835\udc90\ud835\udc96\ud835\udc93 \ud835\udc8e\ud835\udc86\ud835\udc8f\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc90\ud835\udc93?\nAmanda has taught me many things.

{"input": "TO BE COMPLETED", "output": "This week for Oberlin's Black History Month, OUR is celebrating the life and legacy of Zora Neale Hurston. A renowned novelist, anthropologist, folklorist, and filmmaker, Hurston's ethnographic research often contributed to the depth of her literary works. Hurston was born in Notasulga, Alabama, on January 7, 1891, but her family moved to Eatonville, Florida, shortly after, a place that would inspire many of her later works. Hurston attended Howard University and then Barnard College, where she received a B.A. in anthropology in 1928. Hurston traveled through the American South and the Caribbean, documenting Black folklore, publishing her work of literary anthropology, \"Mules and Men\", in 1935. At the same time, Hurston was a leading figure of the Harlem Renaissance, working with Langston Hughes and Wallace Thurman. Many of her literary works discussed issues in Black communities and her struggles as a Black woman. In 1937, Hurston's notable novel, \"Their Eyes Were Watching God\", was published. Throughout the 1940s and 50s, Hurston published works in periodicals. On January 28, 1960, Zora Neale Hurston passed away. OUR recognizes Hurston's incredible contributions to the humanities, and her work is invaluable in documenting the intricacies and nuances of Black experiences. #BlackHistoryMonth #diversity #oberlin #our", "org": "oberlinour"}

While teaching, she studied the compounds of chaulmoogra oil and was able to derive its healing compounds into an injectable form that would alleviate the symptoms of leprosy. Recently after discovering this treatment, however, Ball passed away from accidentally inhaling chlorine gas and was not able to see the extent of her discovery. Furthermore, credit for her discovery was stolen, and it was not until recently that the first treatment for Hansen\u2019s disease was credited to her.

We're looking at patterns across data sets so, for example, say we're looking at a dataset of people in the hospital and were trying to predict whether they will develop a certain type of cancer. So chances are we're going to have a lot of people in that dataset who don't have cancer, and there will only be a few who have the cancer. However what we want to learn about are the ones who have the cancer but if we just plug all that data into the model it can still get a high accuracy by predicting they won't have cancer 100 percent of the time, so we are trying to find ways to to get a higher accuracy with that minority class.\n\ud835\udc6f\ud835\udc90\ud835\udc98 \ud835\udc89\ud835\udc82\ud835\udc94 \ud835\udc95\ud835\udc89\ud835\udc8a\ud835\udc94 \ud835\udc93\ud835\udc86\ud835\udc94\ud835\udc86\ud835\udc82\ud835\udc93\ud835\udc84\ud835\udc89 \ud835\udc94\ud835\udc89\ud835\udc82\ud835\udc91\ud835\udc86\ud835\udc85 \ud835\udc9a\ud835\udc90\ud835\udc96\ud835\udc93 \ud835\udc86\ud835\udc85\ud835\udc96\ud835\udc84\ud835\udc82\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc8a\ud835\udc90\ud835\udc8f?\nI have found research to be a great way to learn outside of the classroom. I can't speak to other disciplines, but in computer science in class you're still problem-solving but its in a very different way than research because for homework you have a task that has been done many times over that people have practiced forever, but in research it demands creativity, and you have to figure out where you're going. \n\ud835\udc7e\ud835\udc89\ud835\udc82\ud835\udc95 \ud835\udc8a\ud835\udc94 \ud835\udc94\ud835\udc90\ud835\udc8e\ud835\udc86\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc89\ud835\udc8a\ud835\udc8f\ud835\udc88 \ud835\udc8a\ud835\udc8e\ud835\udc91\ud835\udc90\ud835\udc93\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc82\ud835\udc8f\ud835\udc95 \ud835\udc9a\ud835\udc90\ud835\udc96 \ud835\udc89\ud835\udc82\ud835\udc97\ud835\udc86 \ud835\udc8d\ud835\udc86\ud835\udc82\ud835\udc93\ud835\udc8f\ud835\udc86\ud835\udc85 \ud835\udc87\ud835\udc93\ud835\udc90\ud835\udc8e \ud835\udc9a\ud835\udc90\ud835\udc96\ud835\udc93 \ud835\udc8e\ud835\udc86\ud835\udc8f\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc90\ud835\udc93?\nI have learned to be thorough and patient from my mentor. Some of our experiments we have to run 3 or 4 times from the top because there was one error where we had to check the data was being processed in a particular way. It was very easy to get involved with research.

{"input": "TO BE COMPLETED", "output": "In commemoration of Black History Month at Oberlin, OUR is featuring Katherine Johnson, a mathematician well-known for performing the calculations of the first journey to the moon in 1969. Born and raised in West Virginia, Johnson was a gifted child in mathematics and quickly advanced in her schooling. At the age of 18, she enrolled into West Virginia State College and in 1937, she graduated with two degrees in mathematics and French. She taught math and French for several years until 1952, when she was recruited to perform and check calculations at the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), now known as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Because of her great curiosity and expertise in mathematics, she advanced to leading the initiative of sending a man into orbit in 1962. Johnson successfully performed these difficult calculations with extreme accuracy. This was only the beginning of her work at NASA, as she also performed the calculations of the Apollo 11 journey to the moon in 1969 and ensured a safe return to Earth of Apollo 13 after malfunctioning. Furthermore, she expanded the Space Shuttle program until 1986, when she retired. For her dedication to NASA, Katherine Johnson was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2015. At 101 years old, Johnson passed away on February 24, 2020.

However, some identities are drastically underrepresented in research at the undergraduate stage and beyond. This dearth in diversity impedes the advancement of knowledge across many fields of research and thus contributes to disparities and injustices in the population. Many organizations seek to rectify this underrepresentation by funding opportunities specific to individuals underrepresented in research. This session offers a space for students underrepresented in research to discuss challenges that they have faced in their academic careers and to hear about opportunities that will support their research endeavors. \nPlease RSVP Here to attend: http://bit.ly/rsvpour \nFull list of events for Research Month: \nOctober 1 - Research month kick off: student research panel, 12:15-1:15pm, Science Center Dye Lecture Hall\n\nOctober 3 - Finding research opportunities at Oberlin and beyond, 7-8:30pm, King 106 \nOctober 7 - Building on experience: research skills for professional development, 7-8:30pm, StudiOC 211\n\nOctober 11 - Lab Crawl: An open house showcasing STEM research opportunities, 11:30-1:30pm, Science Center, King, Carnegie, and Con\n\nOctober 14 - Challenges and opportunities for students underrepresented in research, 12-1:15pm, Afrikan Heritage House Lord Lounge\n\nOctober 30 - Application 101: How to apply to internships and research experiences, 7-8:30pm, King 123", "org": "oberlinour"}
{"input": "TO BE COMPLETED", "output": "Today's underrepresented researcher for Black History Month is Francis Cecil Sumner, also known as the \"Father of Black Psychology\". Born in 1895 in Arkansas, Sumner received a homeschooled education as the educational resources for Black students was lacking. At 15, he was admitted to Lincoln College after taking an entrance exam. In 1915, he graduated with a degree in philosophy. Sumner then began attending Clark University in 1916 to attain a second degree in English. Soon after, he returned to Lincoln College to start his graduate studies in psychology but was interrupted when he was drafted during World War I. When he returned, he completed his dissertation, \"Psychoanalysis of Freud and Adler,\" and he became the first Black person to attain a PhD in Psychology. After his graduate studies, Sumner focused on \"race psychology\", specifically investigating the racial biases in psychology that resulted in theories claiming that African Americans were inferior. Sumner had difficulties receiving funding for his research throughout his career due to racial discrimination. The most extended position he held was the Chair of the Psychology Department at Howard University from 1928 to 1954. During that time, he established many reforms, the biggest being the Psychology Department's separation from the Philosophy Department. After accomplishing much successful work in many fields, Francis Cecil Sumner passed away in 1954. We recognize the great strides of Francis Cecil Sumner in the field of psychology and paving the way for future Black psychologists!\n#diversity #oberlin #research #OUR #BlackHistoryMonth", "org": "oberlinour"}

Additionally, she discovered that the sea releases twice as much carbon dioxide, a significant finding as it indicates that the absorption of carbon dioxide by the sea cannot completely mitigate the effects of global warming. Saruhashi also found a way to measure nuclear contamination that resulted from oceanic nuclear testing in Bikini Atoll in seawater, which proved to be significant. As a result, limits to nuclear testing have now been established to deter further nuclear contamination harmful to people. Throughout her professional life, Saruhashi battled against racial and gender discrimination. To create a more welcoming environment for women in science fields, she established the Society of Japanese Women Scientists, which recognized the work and provided support for female Japanese scientists. Furthermore, she founded the Saruhashi Prize in 1981, which recognized Japanese women scientists for their significant contributions to science. We are inspired by the distinguishing work of Katsuko Saruhashi and are grateful for her commitment to equity in STEM! \n\n#diversity #oberlin #OUR #research", "org": "oberlinour"}

If I have learned anything from working at Studio B these last 3 years, it\u2019s that any community recording studio is only as successful as the quality of Bloopers that occur within it. The purest form of artistic expression, if you\u2019re not comfortable enough to make a good Blooper, you\u2019re not going to be comfortable enough to make a masterful piece of Art. I will spend my holiday season scouring my hard drive for more of the beautiful bloop\u2019s, and suggest you all do the same surrounded by your family and loved ones. Cheers to 2018.

While there, remember to tap!! The hope is that lunch is restored and if that happens, we still expect you to tap as this is a contributing factor that led to lunch being revoked. \n\n-We also are challenging students after fall break to eat at A-house for a week!

The celebrations continued year after year.\n.\n.\n It\u2019s important to note that, Juneteenth isn\u2019t a straightforward story of emancipation, nor did it necessarily improve conditions for many African Americans the next day or even the next decade. \n  Erin Stewart Mauldin said \u201cJuneteenth is neither the beginning nor the end of something. The end of the Civil War and the ending of slavery didn\u2019t happen overnight and was a lot more like a jagged edge than a clean cut.\u201d\n.\n.\nOn that note, do your own research on Juneteenth and learn the history.

These are very trying times and we have experienced so much loss in such a short amount of time. It can feel easy to feel alone, saddened, and disconnected. \nThe 19-20 Drag Ball Committee had spent so much planning a Drag Ball of monumental proportions while also implementing a number of new initiatives to make the event more accessible while also emphasizing some of the traditional aspects of Ball culture. The event had to be canceled and we were disheartened that all of that hard work could not come to fruition as we imagined. However, we recognize that adaptability in a time like this is essential to our wellbeing. While we cannot offer a show on the same scale in the same way, we wanted to offer a fun and virtual alternative.\n\nShelter-in-place restrictions are in place to protect us but they also present an issue to people of an LGBTQ+ experience. Not every person can fully express themselves safely and/or comfortably at home. We see you and we love you. We wanted to do what we could to let you know that no matter where you are we are still family, you are still valid, and wanted to present an opportunity to reconnect with our community. It is not a perfect alternative but it is one that we wanted to provide to continue the legacy of perseverance that Drag Ball embodies and celebrates. \nWe love you and hope to see you tonight! \u2764\ufe0f**", "org": "obiemrc"}

I also accepted an offer for an inaugural role as the director of diversity, equity, and inclusion for the Southern California Institute of Architecture.\nI have grown tremendously in the director role over the last two years and hope that I have helped further Oberlin\u2019s commitment to increased belonging and persistence for BIPOC and LGBTQ+ students.\nI am deeply proud of the ways that we have committed and recommitted ourselves to standing up for each other. This includes your voluntary participation in new MRC workshops on allyship and disrupting anti-Blackness; faculty and staff participation in the Intergroup Dialogues on Race Talk; your sharing our digital resources on antiracism and mental health for BIPOC people; attending mental health roundtables and community welcomes, and even taking a break from a tense election season to de-stress with Obie pets.\nBut I am most proud of how we have shown up for each other during one of the most difficult and relentless times in human history. This pandemic has pushed us to the depths of ourselves, and we\u2019re still here. Still committed. Still growing. Still possessing the audacity to stunt.\nAll MRC programs will continue as planned for the remainder of the spring semester with increased support from staff within the Division of Student Life.\nI have so much gratitude for past and present members of the Legendary Team MRC and the students, staff, and faculty whom I have gotten to know on a professional and personal level during my tenure.\nStay up,\nZahida\n_\nPhoto Credit: Jose Barrera \u201820", "org": "obiemrc"}

{"input": "TO BE COMPLETED", "output": "This week we\u2019re shining a spotlight on former OSTA member and performer Sarah Lariviere! Sarah graduated from Oberlin in 1997 with a major in Theater, and a concentration in Acting. In addition to managing props for OSTA, she performed in several OSTA productions, including \u201cEquus\u201d directed by Greg Copeland \u201894, \u201cThe House of Blue Leaves\u201d directed by Rachel Claff \u201895, and \u201cThe Visit\u201d directed by Thomas Kriegsmann \u201898. Sarah became a social worker after graduation, working with kids and families for over a decade, and has been an author for the past decade. She credits her theatrical training as having helped in both of these areas; using listening skills and improv skills to keep clients engaged and connected in social work, and writing a book requires her to play the role of writer, actors, director, lighting designer, scenery designer, sound person, etc. Her new novel, Riot Act, comes out in July 2024 from Knopf: \u201cIt\u2019s an alternate history about theater kids fighting for freedom of expression in an authoritarian America. Theater was a lifeline for me, and continues to be, even indirectly.\u201d\n\nSarah had this to say about how her time working with OSTA has influenced her life and work: \u201cLearning to collaborate in service of something greater than myself, staying in the moment, trying not to bury my true feelings, or play life small. As an author, I have to be free to make bold, confident choices that are deeply emotionally connected to try to reach readers who want to feel something. That\u2019s acting, but it\u2019s also being authentic, in a big way. I\u2019m still practicing every day, trying to learn how to do that.\u201d", "org": "omta_osta"}

Tommy also directed \u201cAmerican Buffalo\u201d, \u201cThe Visit\u201d, \u201cWaiting for Godot\u201d, and was the co-director of an experimental troupe, /twelv/, with Max Truax \u201898.

His Broadway debut ILLINOISE, a dance-theater adaptation of the Sufjan Stevens album by Jackie Sybblies Drury and Justin Peck, opens today at the St. James Theater and has already received Outer Critics and Drama League nominations, and he was shortlisted for an Oscar this year for Sam Green\u2019s live cinema documentary 32 SOUNDS with JD Samson.\n\nTommy had this to say about his time doing theater at Oberlin: \u201cAs an environment Oberlin was all about pushing for a unique vision - all of my pursuits since have sought developmental paths unique to the work\u2019s form.

More info on proposals and how to sign up below!!\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nOMTA/OSTA approves two or, on rare occasions, more productions at the beginning of each semester or winter term. During the proposal meeting, people proposing shows will be called in one at a time. You will have about 5-7 minutes to pitch to the board the show you are proposing (just some stuff like what the show's about, why you want to direct it, etc.). Sometimes people have slideshows or other visuals to help with their proposal. After your pitch, you might be asked questions by the board. Generally, the more you have prepared, the more likely your proposal is to get approved. This could even be something like already having a set blueprint or blocking notes, but that's not a necessity. What typically is important is having most or all of a production team assembled when you propose (stage manager, lighting designer, sound designer, etc.). Rights are applied for after your proposal is approved.\n\u2014\nPlease note, OMTA already has a musical booked in Wilder Main, so we can only accept an OSTA play this semester to perform in that space. However, if you wish to hold your musical in the Cat or still want us to consider your musical proposal, feel free to still submit one!", "org": "omta_osta"}

This came after a protest organized by professor Yveline Alexis against the poor treatment of professors at Oberlin. We must build on this energy to continue the fight for better working and living conditions for the entire Oberlin community. \n\nThis semester, as the Board continues its heartless attacks on workers and organized labor at Oberlin, we will continue to fight for an end to austerity politics and the undemocratic trustee system.

Unapologetically.\n\nToday, we take stock of our victories and the fight ahead in the best way we know how. We celebrate what makes us Black, beautiful and free.\n\nWelcome to SIX NINETEEN. We invite you to join us this weekend (online or in your community) to take action and make our voices heard. We demand the defunding of the police. We demand an investment in Black communities. We demand the resignation of Donald Trump. We demand to be heard. While we celebrate Blackness and the joy of existing freely, we also are committed to the fight against limitations on our freedom.\n\nToday, we focus on investing in our futures. That means divesting from police and investing in our communities and our needs (education, affordable housing, jobs, etc). Tomorrow, we focus on the cost of inaction. Sunday, we focus on Trump\u2019s resignation. All of these themes fit into our SIX NINETEEN action weekend. We are actively organizing toward freedom.\n\nToday, we speak in one voice, in the names of those we have lost and the futures of those who would come after us. This, too, is democracy. Find ways to action virtually or in your community at sixnineteen.com.

This class is in large part influenced by the work of Katy Pyle and the Ballez company and class in New York.

Food science currently offers us exciting innovations that continue to better the quality of what we eat. However, food science suffers from an internal conflict: do we eat to live, or live to eat? In terms of science and its application to food, this means distinguishing between using science to improve food as a pragmatic product (e.g., through advancements in food safety, nutrition, and yield) and using it to improve the consumer's aesthetic experience of food (e.g., through improving the sensory and psychological experiences). This dilemma has been reflected in the development of breakfast cereal. However, breakfast cereals can also show us that food's aesthetic and pragmatic qualities are not always separate; the future of food science may even rely on merging these qualities. When one considers how food science has changed our relationship to food, especially in the case of breakfast cereal, the apparent split between the pragmatic and aesthetic diminishes, and the two categories can be seen intertwining and even merging.\"\n\nContinue reading in Issue 26 on our website.

The whole piece comes alive under the baton of Michael Sakir, OC \u201906.\n\nThe story takes place in Loxford, a small town in East Suffolk, England. The town folk hurry to find a new May Queen for the upcoming May Festival. Because the people of Loxford prize purity, the purest of them all wins said title. The May Queen is usually a virgin woman; however, no more virgins exist, so they must reluctantly award the May Queen title to the most virginal man in town, Albert Herring. \n\nHavey\u2019s set design showcased Loxford with tall pink and gold two-dimensional buildings that frame the stage and brilliantly capture the town\u2019s rigidity with an Addams Family-esque portrayal of the town folk \u2014 pale-faced, lifeless, and morally dubious, yet somehow likable. However, the town\u2019s youth seemed rosy-cheeked and full of life.

{"input": "TO BE COMPLETED", "output": "My first year at Oberlin, I found myself isolated from my Latino community. Oberlin boasts diversity and inclusion throughout campus but, in reality, most BIPOC students struggle to adjust and find community in a predominantly white institution. For many, the difficulty is in finding the group of peers that create that sense of community. I want this piece to serve as a resource for students on campus who are currently feeling disconnected from their identity-based circles. It wasn\u2019t until I reached out and connected with those around me by joining La Alianza Latinx last spring that I fully realized the vividness of student-led groups. Since Latino Heritage Month recently came to an end, I believe it is appropriate to talk about the different efforts student organizations and members of faculty and staff are making to help the diverse communities on campus.\n\nOne of these individuals is Assistant Director for Career Readiness Vilmarie Perez, who is of Puerto Rican descent. In her year at Oberlin, Perez has devoted her time to finding ways to be involved with BIPOC students on campus. Perez connects with BIPOC students not only through her office hours, but also with the events she coordinates.\n\n\u201cMy main motivation is to serve BIPOC students, Latinx students, and students with disabilities,\u201d Perez said. \u201cI believe that representation matters. I think that I\u2019ve been privileged to be able to facilitate a safe space for BIPOC and Latinx students.\u201d\n\n\ud83d\udcf0Article by Kimberly Rodr\u00edguez Arroyo \n\ud83d\udcf7Photo credits: Serafina Yan", "org": "ocreview"}

{"input": "TO BE COMPLETED", "output": "Post-Thanksgiving break, you can feel the anxiety and dread within the walls of Oberlin College. The event that we all anticipate yet hate is dawning on us: finals. Like most colleges and universities across the country, finals at Oberlin are summative assessments for your courses, often the largest projects of the semester. Unlike other assessments during the school year, they all fall within a five-day period \u2014 this year from Dec. 17\u201321. Finals are preceded by reading period \u2014 four days designed to be solely dedicated for students to study and prepare for their finals. Official sports practices stop, club meetings become rare, and Mudd Center is filled with students until midnight. The usual Oberlin student body, which enjoys overwhelming themselves with as many social activities and extracurriculars as possible, becomes entrenched in academics. While the entire ordeal only spans nine days, it is one of the most exhausting and hated experiences I have been through at Oberlin.\n\nMy first semester last year, I heavily relied on reading period to prepare for my final assessments, as many students do. Classes, my extracurriculars, and playing a sport had made the idea of preparing early for finals seem daunting. I told myself that I would be able to write the majority of my essays and study for my tests during reading period. I woke up each day at 8 a.m. and studied until 1:30 a.m. in Mudd Center, the Science Center, or study rooms. I took breaks only to eat or go for a short walk. Every three hours, I took an Advil to help alleviate my stress headaches, and had at least two coffees a day to keep my mind awake. Once this awful period finally ended, I returned home and slept for 13 hours and found myself painfully sick for the next two weeks. I unfortunately did not learn from my mistakes, repeating a similar process in my second semester.

{"input": "TO BE COMPLETED", "output": "One of the reasons I was attracted to Oberlin was its Gender, Sexuality, and Feminist Studies major. I appreciated that I\u2019d be able to explore my interest in gender studies, and valued the interdisciplinary and intersectional nature of the major, which aims to center issues of sexuality, queerness, and race within gender. As someone interested in the specific experiences of Black and queer women, this was very exciting to me. Unfortunately the major was not as intersectional as I had hoped.\n\nMy first semester at Oberlin, I enrolled in a course called Introduction to Gender, Sexuality, and Feminist Studies. I examined the syllabus with an excited eye. The readings were from many of my favorite authors and intellectuals like Angela Davis, Bell Hooks, and June Jordan, along with an array of authors whose work I had not been exposed to. Despite the diversity emphasized in the course readings, I attended the class and was surprised to find that I was one of a handful of students of color in attendance.\n\nOver time I quickly noticed the impact that the racial makeup of the class had on student-led discussions. While analyzing systems of oppression was expected in classroom discussions, many students who were not POC discussed America\u2019s systems of oppression without race in mind. When referring to America\u2019s power system, which subjugates Brown, Black, impoverished, and queer people, students harshly critiqued the system, rarely acknowledging their own participation and place in upholding the system they critiqued. I remember a particular white student who would often remark on the amusingly cringey things white people would do. Afterward, many other white students in the class would agree and remarked on their own experiences of \u201cridiculous things white people would say.\u201d Click link in bio for more!\n\n\ud83d\udcf0Article by Avery Russell \n\ud83d\udcf7Photo credits: Abe Frato", "org": "ocreview"}

{"input": "TO BE COMPLETED", "output": "On Friday, Nov. 3, I walked into Warner Main and sat down on the crowded mats in front of the bleachers. I was there to see Fall Forward, the annual performance put on by the Oberlin College Dance department. Before I walked into the show, one of my friends told me that there was a controversy about a half-hour senior dance piece that was part of the program for the night. It was about whether or not a piece that took up three dance slots in the show should have been allowed or whether it should have been its own show entirely, as often happens with senior projects. I don\u2019t know what prompted this piece to be placed in Fall Forward, but I\u2019m very glad it was. I am referring to \u201cPatient 6183,\u201d choreographed by College fourth-year Liz Hawk.\n\nThe dance used multiple actors to represent the people in the story, even having them represent different versions of the same character. It used spoken word as well as dance to tell the story of a child who is diagnosed with severe scoliosis and consequently spends their whole life facing the fallout of it. The piece opens with a row of people in lab coats surrounding a bed occupied by a single person. The \u201cdoctors\u201d begin listing the conditions of the patient, speaking over each other until the words are unintelligible \u00ad\u2014 a mess of medical jargon. Then the person on the bed uses their own voice to tell the audience \u201chow fucked up I am.\u201d This set the tone for the whole piece, and simultaneously made me sit up and pay attention.\n\nI was diagnosed with a rare bone condition when I was seven years old. As a result of that, I have spent most of my life in and out of hospitals. I was subsequently diagnosed with several other exciting things like Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome \u2014 as fun as it sounds \u2014 and scoliosis \u2014 though not as bad as that of the subject of the dance. At this point I am well and able-bodied, but that makes me a medical anomaly and a fascination of doctors. I remember being so proud that the medical student assisting with my care wrote a paper about me when I was eight.....

Students work with four college mentors and the foundation to secure internships and career opportunities throughout the year. At Oberlin, the Posse Foundation has recruited their students exclusively from Chicago, but recently, Oberlin has announced the expansion of the program to recruit from Houston as well. The first Posse Scholars from Houston will begin studies alongside the 19th Chicago cohort. \n\n\u201cWe are proud of our long and productive history with the Posse Foundation, and we will recruit Chicago Posse #18 this year,\u201d Manuel Carballo, vice president and dean of Admissions and Financial Aid, wrote in an email to the Review. \u201cWe recruited our first Posse cohort in 2006 and have welcomed more than 170 Posse Scholars to campus since then. The Admissions Office works with a number of community-based organizations and programs that help us find amazing, talented students who might not otherwise be exposed to colleges like Oberlin.\u201d\n\nThe College has received a $500,000, five-year grant that will help expand into Houston and strengthen Oberlin\u2019s commitment to the program. This will allow for 10 students to be selected from both Houston and Chicago, with the process starting in December 2024. There are currently four Chicago Posse cohorts on campus, with the 18th group being recruited this year. The goal is to add eight mentors and four cohorts from Houston by 2028.\n\n\ud83d\udcf0Article by Nikki Keating\n\ud83d\udcf7Photo courtesy of Scott Shaw", "org": "ocreview"}

Braimah, who was born in Ghana and grew up in St. Louis, is not a percussionist \u2014 he plays only one instrument. His work collaborating with artists and teaching has aided in keeping the djembe tradition alive.\n\n\u201cOne of the first things [Braimah] tells us is that if you\u2019re coming to this class to be in a drum circle or improve your rhythm and beat counting, this class is not for you,\u201d College fourth-year Chudi Martin Jr., who has been playing with the Djembe Orchestra since its inception, said. \u201cThe expectations, demands, and needs of this course are going to be drastically different.\u201d\n\nMany believe the origins of the djembe can be traced back to the 12th Century. Historians generally credit blacksmiths in the Malinke tribe of modern-day Mali for stretching the first rawhide across a djembe. As the empire of Mali expanded, and people migrated to modern-day Senegal, Mauritania, Guinea, and beyond, djembe music evolved and diversified. According to their descendants, the word djembe comes from the saying, \u201canke dj\u00e9, anke be,\u201d which means \u201ceveryone gather together in peace.\u201d This also defines the djembe\u2019s main purpose.\n\n\ud83d\udcf0Article by Nicolas Stebbins\n\ud83d\udcf7Photo credits: Erin Koo", "org": "ocreview"}

{"input": "TO BE COMPLETED", "output": "Quoted as an \u201cemerging young ensemble to watch\u201d by the Hyde Park Herald, the Poiesis Quartet was formed at Oberlin College and Conservatory during the fall semester of 2022. The members of the quartet are Conservatory fourth-year violinist Sarah Ying Ma, Conservatory fourth-year violinist Max Ball, violist Jasper de Boor, OC \u201923, and double-degree fourth-year cellist Drew Dansby. The quartet found success very quickly, including achievements such as the gold medal at the Saint Paul String Quartet Competition and first place at the Fischoff National Chamber Music Competition. Only Dansby and Ma were interviewed for this article.\n\nHow did the quartet form? SYM: I wanted to do competitions, specifically the Fischoff Chamber Music Competition because I had never done it before. When I transferred from Juilliard in January 2022, I was looking for a group, but I didn\u2019t know anybody. I asked Drew, because I knew we had mutual friends from social media. Originally, we were going for a piano trio, but we found Jasper and Max, and we got together to play. We all agreed on competitions as a group, and we did the Advanced Quartet Seminar together in our first semester.\n\nAt what point did you recognize your success as a group? SYM: After performing at the St. Paul Competition we listened back to our performance, and that was the first time I really thought to myself, \u201cOh, wow, we actually have something good.\u201d And I remember before that I would listen to our recordings and always have a problem with it. I would think that we would never win anything. After the St. Paul Competition, we won the gold medal, and the BIPOC/Female Composer prize, which we did not think we would win.  But when we listened to it back, I felt like there\u2019s something. There\u2019s an energy here that I never had before in a chamber group. And I was interested in it. And I started exploring it more in rehearsals. I still \u2014 even to this day \u2014 think all four of us have doubts about ourselves as a group; we still question whether we could work together. But we are all committed to getting to a point where we feel secure in that.\n\n\ud83d\udcf0Article by: Emir Efe \n\ud83d\udcf7Photo credits: Peter Ringenberg", "org": "ocreview"}
