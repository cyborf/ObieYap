All grieving for rituals lost.\n\nYet, as the spring and summer unfolded, and in the wake of social and cultural revolution, Oberlin’s students resilience, adaptivity, and care shines through.

Students work with four college mentors and the foundation to secure internships and career opportunities throughout the year. At Oberlin, the Posse Foundation has recruited their students exclusively from Chicago, but recently, Oberlin has announced the expansion of the program to recruit from Houston as well. The first Posse Scholars from Houston will begin studies alongside the 19th Chicago cohort. \n\n“We are proud of our long and productive history with the Posse Foundation, and we will recruit Chicago Posse #18 this year,” Manuel Carballo, vice president and dean of Admissions and Financial Aid, wrote in an email to the Review. “We recruited our first Posse cohort in 2006 and have welcomed more than 170 Posse Scholars to campus since then. The Admissions Office works with a number of community-based organizations and programs that help us find amazing, talented students who might not otherwise be exposed to colleges like Oberlin.”\n\nThe College has received a $500,000, five-year grant that will help expand into Houston and strengthen Oberlin’s commitment to the program. This will allow for 10 students to be selected from both Houston and Chicago, with the process starting in December 2024. There are currently four Chicago Posse cohorts on campus, with the 18th group being recruited this year. The goal is to add eight mentors and four cohorts from Houston by 2028.\n\n📰Article by Nikki Keating\n📷Photo courtesy of Scott Shaw",

An area that looked and felt different from the rest of their rooms so it was easy to distinguish between a work environment and a home environment. \n\nIn order to achieve that each space, regardless of if they share some characteristics, is unique in layout and setup, and a lot of the time have been expanded with items from the dancers personal collections. Each set and costume is inspired by the dancer's unique characters they created with the lighting and color pallete acting as a unifying element.“\n\nTo see more of Homer-Drummond’s initial design concepts, head over to @bigbadspender.\n\nSeen above: a collage of the initial design board for Big Spender’s costume design.\n\nYou can register NOW to see Big Spender which will be available to watch February 19 - 21 at the link in our bio.",

Impacts of sexual violence: Disconnect with spirit, culture, or self. Physical injury - lasting short or long term. Trauma, hyper-vigilance, flashbacks. Difficulty trusting or believing others. Entire medicine wheel: spiritual, physical, emotional, mental. \n\n2) Sexual violence is pervasive. American Indians are 2.5 times more likely to experience sexual assault compared to all other races. 34% of Native women are raped in their lifetimes. At least 84% of perpetrators of these crimes are non-Native men. \n\n3) Sexual violence and trauma. Following an assault, common outcomes include poor mental health (PTSD, acute stress disorders, depression, sleep disorders, anxiety, suicidal ideation). Decreased sexual urges/pleasure, increased sexual risk behaviors, substance use and physical health problems. Revitalization (is) also commonly reported for Indigenous survivors of childhood sexual abuse. \n\n4) Sexual Violence is Preventable. Protective factors positively associated with health and social outcomes for American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) youth include: Personal wellness, positive self-image, self-efficacy, familial and non-familial connectedness, positive opportunities, positive social norms, cultural connectedness.",

Performers will devise portions of the show. The responsibility of embodying each character will be shared across the ensemble by passing roles between performers throughout the play. The play is an adaptation: a story about King Midas, as well as The Purple Flower, a play by Marita Bonner.\n\nFrom the Directors: At its core, our show follows a fractured community trying to heal from the systematic oppression of the tyrant King Midas.

It is critical that these systems operate safely and correctly, especially in the presence of an adversary with a strong (usually financial) motive to make the systems misbehave in some way.\n\nIn this talk, Professor Checkoway will describe one of the key tools computer security researchers and practitioners use to secure these critical computer systems: adversarial thinking. He will give examples of how thinking like an adversary can demonstrate the existence of vulnerabilities and suggest defenses against attacks in multiple domains, including examples from his work hacking computers used in cars and general aviation.",

The more that women can move into spaces traditionally occupied by men, the fewer people will believe Fuller’s actions were part of a publicity stunt.”▫️\nAlso in the Sports section this week, check out the final installment of the We Keep Yeoing series following the cross country and track and field teams, and an interview with Alex Scott on the friendships that have shaped his college career on and off campus.▫️\n📸 Hunter Dyke/Mizzou Athletics via Getty Images",

Often responsible for the propagation of chronic symptoms including fatigue, nausea, and chronic pain, autoimmune neuropathy is an increasingly important area of research. Despite the pressing need for further research on this topic, scientific knowledge on this class of disorders remains largely unknown. A few disorders have known initial triggers and modes of pathogenesis that have been well-defined but most remain a mystery. As a result of this void in autoimmune neuropathy research, public awareness is lacking, pharmaceutical development is stunted, and patients are left in vulnerable positions with few treatment options and very little information about their conditions or, for that matter, validation of their pain.\" Continue reading in Issue 23 on our website.

We sat with the collective grief and pain that ought be every human being’s burden to bear as the Israeli occupation continues to violate every aspect of humanity.

The Xenobots, designed by AI, are reshaping our understanding of life's replicative capabilities.\n\n🌍 The researchers emphasize the importance of understanding and controlling self-replicating systems.

        "output": "This week for Black History Month, OUR is featuring bell hooks, a renowned writer and activist that explored the intersectionality of race, gender, and class, particularly focusing on Black women's identities. hooks grew up in southern Kentucky and attended a racially segregated school until the 1960s, which influenced her feminist activism and resistance to racism. At 19, hooks began writing her book \"Ain't I a Woman\", published a decade later. bell hooks continued her higher education and eventually obtained a doctorate in English literature at the University of California, Santa Cruz. After that, she began her teaching career, which she considered to be the most powerful form of political resistance. Some of the schools she instructed were the University of Southern California, Yale University, and Oberlin College. Throughout her life, bell hooks wrote over 30 books and many scholarly articles before passing away on December 15, 2021. We are greatly honored by bell hooks' remarkable work, teaching, and activism and remember her contributions to feminist thought! \n#BlackHistoryMonth #diversity #oberlin #OUR",

        "output": "\"Have you ever wandered down the cereal aisle, at a loss for words at the bounty of different varieties and flavors? You have food science to thank for that! Food science currently offers us exciting innovations that continue to better the quality of what we eat. However, food science suffers from an internal conflict: do we eat to live, or live to eat? In terms of science and its application to food, this means distinguishing between using science to improve food as a pragmatic product (e.g., through advancements in food safety, nutrition, and yield) and using it to improve the consumer's aesthetic experience of food (e.g., through improving the sensory and psychological experiences). This dilemma has been reflected in the development of breakfast cereal. However, breakfast cereals can also show us that food's aesthetic and pragmatic qualities are not always separate; the future of food science may even rely on merging these qualities. When one considers how food science has changed our relationship to food, especially in the case of breakfast cereal, the apparent split between the pragmatic and aesthetic diminishes, and the two categories can be seen intertwining and even merging.\"\n\nContinue reading in Issue 26 on our website.
