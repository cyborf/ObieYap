All grieving for rituals lost.\n\nYet, as the spring and summer unfolded, and in the wake of social and cultural revolution, Oberlin’s students resilience, adaptivity, and care shines through.

Students work with four college mentors and the foundation to secure internships and career opportunities throughout the year. At Oberlin, the Posse Foundation has recruited their students exclusively from Chicago, but recently, Oberlin has announced the expansion of the program to recruit from Houston as well. The first Posse Scholars from Houston will begin studies alongside the 19th Chicago cohort. \n\n“We are proud of our long and productive history with the Posse Foundation, and we will recruit Chicago Posse #18 this year,” Manuel Carballo, vice president and dean of Admissions and Financial Aid, wrote in an email to the Review. “We recruited our first Posse cohort in 2006 and have welcomed more than 170 Posse Scholars to campus since then. The Admissions Office works with a number of community-based organizations and programs that help us find amazing, talented students who might not otherwise be exposed to colleges like Oberlin.”\n\nThe College has received a $500,000, five-year grant that will help expand into Houston and strengthen Oberlin’s commitment to the program. This will allow for 10 students to be selected from both Houston and Chicago, with the process starting in December 2024. There are currently four Chicago Posse cohorts on campus, with the 18th group being recruited this year. The goal is to add eight mentors and four cohorts from Houston by 2028.\n\n📰Article by Nikki Keating\n📷Photo courtesy of Scott Shaw",

An area that looked and felt different from the rest of their rooms so it was easy to distinguish between a work environment and a home environment. \n\nIn order to achieve that each space, regardless of if they share some characteristics, is unique in layout and setup, and a lot of the time have been expanded with items from the dancers personal collections. Each set and costume is inspired by the dancer's unique characters they created with the lighting and color pallete acting as a unifying element.“\n\nTo see more of Homer-Drummond’s initial design concepts, head over to @bigbadspender.\n\nSeen above: a collage of the initial design board for Big Spender’s costume design.\n\nYou can register NOW to see Big Spender which will be available to watch February 19 - 21 at the link in our bio.",

Impacts of sexual violence: Disconnect with spirit, culture, or self. Physical injury - lasting short or long term. Trauma, hyper-vigilance, flashbacks. Difficulty trusting or believing others. Entire medicine wheel: spiritual, physical, emotional, mental. \n\n2) Sexual violence is pervasive. American Indians are 2.5 times more likely to experience sexual assault compared to all other races. 34% of Native women are raped in their lifetimes. At least 84% of perpetrators of these crimes are non-Native men. \n\n3) Sexual violence and trauma. Following an assault, common outcomes include poor mental health (PTSD, acute stress disorders, depression, sleep disorders, anxiety, suicidal ideation). Decreased sexual urges/pleasure, increased sexual risk behaviors, substance use and physical health problems. Revitalization (is) also commonly reported for Indigenous survivors of childhood sexual abuse. \n\n4) Sexual Violence is Preventable. Protective factors positively associated with health and social outcomes for American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) youth include: Personal wellness, positive self-image, self-efficacy, familial and non-familial connectedness, positive opportunities, positive social norms, cultural connectedness.",

The play is an adaptation: a story about King Midas, as well as The Purple Flower, a play by Marita Bonner.\n\nFrom the Directors: At its core, our show follows a fractured community trying to heal from the systematic oppression of the tyrant King Midas.

It is critical that these systems operate safely and correctly, especially in the presence of an adversary with a strong (usually financial) motive to make the systems misbehave in some way.\n\nIn this talk, Professor Checkoway will describe one of the key tools computer security researchers and practitioners use to secure these critical computer systems: adversarial thinking. He will give examples of how thinking like an adversary can demonstrate the existence of vulnerabilities and suggest defenses against attacks in multiple domains, including examples from his work hacking computers used in cars and general aviation.",

The more that women can move into spaces traditionally occupied by men, the fewer people will believe Fuller’s actions were part of a publicity stunt.”▫️\nAlso in the Sports section this week, check out the final installment of the We Keep Yeoing series following the cross country and track and field teams, and an interview with Alex Scott on the friendships that have shaped his college career on and off campus.▫️\n📸 Hunter Dyke/Mizzou Athletics via Getty Images",

Often responsible for the propagation of chronic symptoms including fatigue, nausea, and chronic pain, autoimmune neuropathy is an increasingly important area of research. Despite the pressing need for further research on this topic, scientific knowledge on this class of disorders remains largely unknown. A few disorders have known initial triggers and modes of pathogenesis that have been well-defined but most remain a mystery. As a result of this void in autoimmune neuropathy research, public awareness is lacking, pharmaceutical development is stunted, and patients are left in vulnerable positions with few treatment options and very little information about their conditions or, for that matter, validation of their pain.\" Continue reading in Issue 23 on our website.

We sat with the collective grief and pain that ought be every human being’s burden to bear as the Israeli occupation continues to violate every aspect of humanity.

        "output": "This week for Black History Month, OUR is featuring bell hooks, a renowned writer and activist that explored the intersectionality of race, gender, and class, particularly focusing on Black women's identities. hooks grew up in southern Kentucky and attended a racially segregated school until the 1960s, which influenced her feminist activism and resistance to racism. At 19, hooks began writing her book \"Ain't I a Woman\", published a decade later. bell hooks continued her higher education and eventually obtained a doctorate in English literature at the University of California, Santa Cruz. After that, she began her teaching career, which she considered to be the most powerful form of political resistance. Some of the schools she instructed were the University of Southern California, Yale University, and Oberlin College. Throughout her life, bell hooks wrote over 30 books and many scholarly articles before passing away on December 15, 2021. We are greatly honored by bell hooks' remarkable work, teaching, and activism and remember her contributions to feminist thought! \n#BlackHistoryMonth #diversity #oberlin #OUR",

Food science currently offers us exciting innovations that continue to better the quality of what we eat. However, food science suffers from an internal conflict: do we eat to live, or live to eat? In terms of science and its application to food, this means distinguishing between using science to improve food as a pragmatic product (e.g., through advancements in food safety, nutrition, and yield) and using it to improve the consumer's aesthetic experience of food (e.g., through improving the sensory and psychological experiences). This dilemma has been reflected in the development of breakfast cereal. However, breakfast cereals can also show us that food's aesthetic and pragmatic qualities are not always separate; the future of food science may even rely on merging these qualities. When one considers how food science has changed our relationship to food, especially in the case of breakfast cereal, the apparent split between the pragmatic and aesthetic diminishes, and the two categories can be seen intertwining and even merging.\"\n\nContinue reading in Issue 26 on our website.

Doing geology research in context to building computer programs allowed me to develop a deeper understanding of both fields. Once I figured out what I wanted to do with my life I started looking into graduate school programs for geology, something that as a computer science major I didn't really have to do because it’s a little easier to get a job in. What’s really unique about research at Oberlin as an undergrad is that  we have a small team so we go out and collect the samples that we want. At other institutions it’s just a lot of research without the field work experience and I think the field work experience is one of the most valuable parts of geology. Having research experience prior to my first year helped me navigate my first year, it taught me to pick apart big projects, how to work as a team and that I was able to rely on other people and not just myself.\n\n𝑾𝒉𝒂𝒕 𝒊𝒔 𝒔𝒐𝒎𝒆𝒕𝒉𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝒊𝒎𝒑𝒐𝒓𝒕𝒂𝒏𝒕 𝒚𝒐𝒖 𝒉𝒂𝒗𝒆 𝒍𝒆𝒂𝒓𝒏𝒆𝒅 𝒇𝒓𝒐𝒎 𝒚𝒐𝒖𝒓 𝒎𝒆𝒏𝒕𝒐𝒓?\nAmanda has taught me many things. She’s one of the top people in her field and she’s published so many papers it’s insane. She taught me that it’s ok to mess up and fail and its ok to have lots of works in progress. She gives me the freedom to finish my task at my own pace. She believes in my ability to get things done and she’s constantly reassuring me that I’m doing good. She’s just a really amazing person.\n\n#researchers #geology #oberlincollege #undergrad",

Images of broad-shouldered, well defined, and spray-tanned individuals holding a gallon jug of water probably come to mind. The science behind how those individuals came to look that way — and why they are carrying a gallon of water — is quite fascinating. Our understanding of what is required to achieve this hypermuscular state reaches down to the cellular level. Those who participate in bodybuilding must manipulate multiple metabolic pathways to achieve their desired result. The universal practice in this sport involves following a distinct diet combined with strenuous physical activity in order to minimize body fat and maximize muscle tissue. The Merriam Webster Dictionary defines bodybuilding as “the developing of the body through exercise and diet.” If bodybuilding was easy, then many more individuals would try to participate. It requires a substantial amount of discipline and mental strength. Critics may ask, “why going through such a rigorous diet and exercise routine is worth competing?” For those who make it to the professional level, the top placements receive prize money, and for many, the experience of winning is a compelling enough reason to continue.\"\n\nContinue reading in Issue 26 on our website.

Ocampo-Friedmann was born in Manila, Philippines and obtained a degree in botany from the University of the Philippines in 1958. She then completed her master’s at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem before returning to the Philippines to work. In 1973, she obtained a PhD at Florida State University. Ocampo-Friedmann and her husband often traveled to conduct research on algae and microorganisms. In particular, their trip to the Dry Valleys located in Antarctica was groundbreaking. The Dry Valleys are devoid of ice and snow and are characterized by their low humidity, so when the couple found microorganisms, now known as cryptoendoliths, living within the rock under extreme conditions, this discovery has implications for life in extreme environments. The couple successfully grew a culture of these microorganisms in a laboratory, and after writing a paper highlighting their discovery, their research supported the theory of the possibility of life on Mars.

Her experience with cats spans approximately 20 years, and her initial interest was sparked when a cat was killed in front of her house. \n\n“We discovered that she had kittens,” Burgess said. “I wanted to take them, so I learned how to raise them just by working with [my vet].” \n\nToday, she raises approximately 75–100 kittens a year, a handful of them only a couple days old and half of them unweaned. During the day, these kittens live in the Ginko Gallery & Studio, where students and community members can visit and spend time with them, helping to socialize them. \n\n“That’s the only difference between a feral cat and a domestic cat, whether they’ve had a good experience with humans in that first eight weeks of their life,” Burgess said. “Otherwise, they’re basically a wild animal.” Click link in bio for more!\n\n📰Article by Sydney Collinger\n📷Photo credits: Eloise Rich",

        "output": "On Oct. 17, top National Collegiate Athletic Association officials were given documents and videos from an outside investigative firm about the University of Michigan football program utilizing sign stealing, which consists of various methods — in this case, illegal methods defined by the NCAA — to decrypt signals coaches on the opposing team use to communicate to their members about play calls. The firm claimed to have acquired them from computer drives that were maintained and accessed by several University of Michigan coaches. Soon after, the Big Ten opened a sign-stealing investigation into Michigan, with Michigan staffer Connor Stalions being the ringleader of the operation.\n\nStalions was originally a volunteer assistant in 2015, but officially became part of their staff in 2022. A Michigan native, his parents both went to University of Michigan. Stalions played football throughout his childhood and his dad was a football coach for an eighth grade team. He graduated from the Naval academy in 2017, where he worked as a volunteer football assistant during his undergraduate years. He also wrote a 550–600 page document called the Michigan Manifesto that he managed daily, which outlined his 15-year blueprint for taking over the University of Michigan Football program and becoming head coach. Stalions is suspended with pay from his role for the Wolverines due to sign-stealing allegations.\n\n📰Article by Andrea Nguyen and Micah Rodriguez\n📷Photo courtesy of Norm Hall",
