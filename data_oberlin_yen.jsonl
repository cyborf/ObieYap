All grieving for rituals lost.\n\nYet, as the spring and summer unfolded, and in the wake of social and cultural revolution, Oberlin’s students resilience, adaptivity, and care shines through.

Students work with four college mentors and the foundation to secure internships and career opportunities throughout the year. At Oberlin, the Posse Foundation has recruited their students exclusively from Chicago, but recently, Oberlin has announced the expansion of the program to recruit from Houston as well. The first Posse Scholars from Houston will begin studies alongside the 19th Chicago cohort. \n\n“We are proud of our long and productive history with the Posse Foundation, and we will recruit Chicago Posse #18 this year,” Manuel Carballo, vice president and dean of Admissions and Financial Aid, wrote in an email to the Review. “We recruited our first Posse cohort in 2006 and have welcomed more than 170 Posse Scholars to campus since then. The Admissions Office works with a number of community-based organizations and programs that help us find amazing, talented students who might not otherwise be exposed to colleges like Oberlin.”\n\nThe College has received a $500,000, five-year grant that will help expand into Houston and strengthen Oberlin’s commitment to the program. This will allow for 10 students to be selected from both Houston and Chicago, with the process starting in December 2024. There are currently four Chicago Posse cohorts on campus, with the 18th group being recruited this year. The goal is to add eight mentors and four cohorts from Houston by 2028.\n\n📰Article by Nikki Keating\n📷Photo courtesy of Scott Shaw",

An area that looked and felt different from the rest of their rooms so it was easy to distinguish between a work environment and a home environment. \n\nIn order to achieve that each space, regardless of if they share some characteristics, is unique in layout and setup, and a lot of the time have been expanded with items from the dancers personal collections. Each set and costume is inspired by the dancer's unique characters they created with the lighting and color pallete acting as a unifying element.“\n\nTo see more of Homer-Drummond’s initial design concepts, head over to @bigbadspender.\n\nSeen above: a collage of the initial design board for Big Spender’s costume design.\n\nYou can register NOW to see Big Spender which will be available to watch February 19 - 21 at the link in our bio.",

Impacts of sexual violence: Disconnect with spirit, culture, or self. Physical injury - lasting short or long term. Trauma, hyper-vigilance, flashbacks. Difficulty trusting or believing others. Entire medicine wheel: spiritual, physical, emotional, mental. \n\n2) Sexual violence is pervasive. American Indians are 2.5 times more likely to experience sexual assault compared to all other races. 34% of Native women are raped in their lifetimes. At least 84% of perpetrators of these crimes are non-Native men. \n\n3) Sexual violence and trauma. Following an assault, common outcomes include poor mental health (PTSD, acute stress disorders, depression, sleep disorders, anxiety, suicidal ideation). Decreased sexual urges/pleasure, increased sexual risk behaviors, substance use and physical health problems. Revitalization (is) also commonly reported for Indigenous survivors of childhood sexual abuse. \n\n4) Sexual Violence is Preventable. Protective factors positively associated with health and social outcomes for American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) youth include: Personal wellness, positive self-image, self-efficacy, familial and non-familial connectedness, positive opportunities, positive social norms, cultural connectedness.",

Performers will devise portions of the show. The responsibility of embodying each character will be shared across the ensemble by passing roles between performers throughout the play. The play is an adaptation: a story about King Midas, as well as The Purple Flower, a play by Marita Bonner.\n\nFrom the Directors: At its core, our show follows a fractured community trying to heal from the systematic oppression of the tyrant King Midas. Because of this, we’re especially wanting to work with actors of color; very excited to see you on Saturday!",
