I\u2019m writing this so that we remember to check in on our friends, especially those with a close connection to the Israeli-Palestinian territory. I\u2019m writing this to raise awareness of how this issue has polarized and disconnected the Oberlin community.\n\nIt has been a complex and difficult experience to exist as a Jewish person at Oberlin who strongly believes in and advocates for the freedom of the Palestinian people. I do not believe that complex and difficult experiences should be avoided. It is through this discomfort that we can all grow into the best versions of ourselves, able to hold nuanced and compassionate opinions.\n\nIn times of tragedy and loss, it is of the utmost importance that we support each other in our grief and acknowledge the collective suffering that we are experiencing. Oberlin is a community that emphasizes the importance of empathy and compassion as well as justice and activism. But have we been holding ourselves true to these ideals? I\u2019ve noticed that some of the activism that has been happening on campus lately does not seem to come from a space of compassion, and it is certainly not leading to any justice.\n\n\ud83d\udcf0Article by Andy Roshal \n\ud83d\udcf7Photo credits: Eloise Rich"}

There has been a substantial amount of research on the impact that private research groups have on adopting sustainable technologies. However, private groups are not incentivized to research environmental technologies because the optimal path for them is to develop profitable innovations. On the other hand, little research has been conducted on the impact of public research organizations, though they may be the key to normalizing the usage of green technologies. Climate change is occurring at an astonishing rate, and the large corporations responsible for pollution need to become more ecologically thoughtful. Government legislation is crucial in motivating private industries to implement environmentally-friendly company policies.\"\n\nContinue reading in Issue 27 on our website.

Bejar's music is fluid, as prone to the sumptuous textures of yacht-rock as it is to prickly guitar ballads. His latest, 2022's Labrynthitis, was a critical triumph, and the record continues his evolution into one of the most distinct songwriters working today. He's joined by opener Shana Cleveland (of La Luz)."}

In readings, discussions, research and performance of scenes in class, we observe changes in voice, style and narrative in American theatrical writing.  As the end of the 20th century approached, how did these playwrights read their changing times, calculate the weight of history and invent new forms of expression?  How has that process continued into the 21st century? We interrogate the ways in which race, cultural identifications, gender, sexual orientation, gender identities, class and regionality play roles in the development of writers\u2019 voices. \n\n\ud83d\udcf7 Tanya Rosen-Jones '97"}

The members of the quartet are Conservatory fourth-year violinist Sarah Ying Ma, Conservatory fourth-year violinist Max Ball, violist Jasper de Boor, OC \u201923, and double-degree fourth-year cellist Drew Dansby. The quartet found success very quickly, including achievements such as the gold medal at the Saint Paul String Quartet Competition and first place at the Fischoff National Chamber Music Competition. Only Dansby and Ma were interviewed for this article.\n\nHow did the quartet form? SYM: I wanted to do competitions, specifically the Fischoff Chamber Music Competition because I had never done it before. When I transferred from Juilliard in January 2022, I was looking for a group, but I didn\u2019t know anybody. I asked Drew, because I knew we had mutual friends from social media. Originally, we were going for a piano trio, but we found Jasper and Max, and we got together to play. We all agreed on competitions as a group, and we did the Advanced Quartet Seminar together in our first semester.\n\nAt what point did you recognize your success as a group? SYM: After performing at the St. Paul Competition we listened back to our performance, and that was the first time I really thought to myself, \u201cOh, wow, we actually have something good.\u201d And I remember before that I would listen to our recordings and always have a problem with it. I would think that we would never win anything. After the St. Paul Competition, we won the gold medal, and the BIPOC/Female Composer prize, which we did not think we would win.  But when we listened to it back, I felt like there\u2019s something. There\u2019s an energy here that I never had before in a chamber group. And I was interested in it. And I started exploring it more in rehearsals. I still \u2014 even to this day \u2014 think all four of us have doubts about ourselves as a group; we still question whether we could work together. But we are all committed to getting to a point where we feel secure in that.\n\n\ud83d\udcf0Article by: Emir Efe \n\ud83d\udcf7Photo credits: Peter Ringenberg"}

I also accepted an offer for an inaugural role as the director of diversity, equity, and inclusion for the Southern California Institute of Architecture.\nI have grown tremendously in the director role over the last two years and hope that I have helped further Oberlin\u2019s commitment to increased belonging and persistence for BIPOC and LGBTQ+ students.\nI am deeply proud of the ways that we have committed and recommitted ourselves to standing up for each other. This includes your voluntary participation in new MRC workshops on allyship and disrupting anti-Blackness; faculty and staff participation in the Intergroup Dialogues on Race Talk; your sharing our digital resources on antiracism and mental health for BIPOC people; attending mental health roundtables and community welcomes, and even taking a break from a tense election season to de-stress with Obie pets.\nBut I am most proud of how we have shown up for each other during one of the most difficult and relentless times in human history. This pandemic has pushed us to the depths of ourselves, and we\u2019re still here. Still committed. Still growing. Still possessing the audacity to stunt.\nAll MRC programs will continue as planned for the remainder of the spring semester with increased support from staff within the Division of Student Life.\nI have so much gratitude for past and present members of the Legendary Team MRC and the students, staff, and faculty whom I have gotten to know on a professional and personal level during my tenure.\nStay up,\nZahida\n_\nPhoto Credit: Jose Barrera \u201820"}

Ocampo-Friedmann was born in Manila, Philippines and obtained a degree in botany from the University of the Philippines in 1958. She then completed her master\u2019s at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem before returning to the Philippines to work. In 1973, she obtained a PhD at Florida State University. Ocampo-Friedmann and her husband often traveled to conduct research on algae and microorganisms. In particular, their trip to the Dry Valleys located in Antarctica was groundbreaking. The Dry Valleys are devoid of ice and snow and are characterized by their low humidity, so when the couple found microorganisms, now known as cryptoendoliths, living within the rock under extreme conditions, this discovery has implications for life in extreme environments. The couple successfully grew a culture of these microorganisms in a laboratory, and after writing a paper highlighting their discovery, their research supported the theory of the possibility of life on Mars.

Then, on January 5, 2020, the WHO released a statement that is chilling to read in retrospect, wherein they asserted, \u201cthere is limited information to determine the overall risk of this reported cluster of pneumonia of unknown etiology \u2026 The symptoms reported among the patients are common to several respiratory diseases.\u201d We soon learned the etiology (cause of the disease), which attributed the outbreak to a novel coronavirus. We have also come to understand the risk, although that process has been long and far more painful. Though we have given the disease a name \u2013 the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) \u2013 we are still struggling to explain its effect on the body.\"\n\nContinue reading in Issue 27 on our website.

Positioning ourselves in a space to understand various aspects relating to the Palestinian genocide allows us to learn exactly how colonialism and white supremacy infiltrates every facet of life. It strengthens the solidarity we seek with Palestinians and those fighting for Palestine across the globe. We looked to Hind Rajab at the 5pm rally, heard the mourning cries of countless poets, news updates. We sat with the collective grief and pain that ought be every human being\u2019s burden to bear as the Israeli occupation continues to violate every aspect of humanity. This educational space, the people\u2019s library, and the skill sets that are coming together in order to fundraise, educate, and commune are in a constant state of development. As we continue to establish these foundations, we again remind @oberlincollege that nothing about genocide is business as usual, and they will not be allowed to simply avert their eyes and sweep us under the rug while our tuition and their salaries are directly intertwined with genocide."}

{"input": "Tease article on bodybuilding in The Synapse magazine", "output": "\"Bodybuilding is an incredible sport that tests a human\u2019s physical limits. Images of broad-shouldered, well defined, and spray-tanned individuals holding a gallon jug of water probably come to mind. The science behind how those individuals came to look that way \u2014 and why they are carrying a gallon of water \u2014 is quite fascinating. Our understanding of what is required to achieve this hypermuscular state reaches down to the cellular level. Those who participate in bodybuilding must manipulate multiple metabolic pathways to achieve their desired result. The universal practice in this sport involves following a distinct diet combined with strenuous physical activity in order to minimize body fat and maximize muscle tissue. The Merriam Webster Dictionary defines bodybuilding as \u201cthe developing of the body through exercise and diet.\u201d If bodybuilding was easy, then many more individuals would try to participate. It requires a substantial amount of discipline and mental strength. Critics may ask, \u201cwhy going through such a rigorous diet and exercise routine is worth competing?\u201d For those who make it to the professional level, the top placements receive prize money, and for many, the experience of winning is a compelling enough reason to continue.\"\n\nContinue reading in Issue 26 on our website.

We are addressing your failure to fulfill the needs of the Oberlin community from an \u201ceducational, developmental, and community based framework\u201d.\n\nYou are resting on a throne of hypocrisy and apathy that directly contradicts the so-called progressive legacy of Oberlin and the moral superiority you love to parade.\n\nLest you forget \u2014 Oberlin\u2019s history of activism and social change has always been accredited to the students, faculty, and community members \u2014 not the faces of the institution. We will never forget how the institution allowed the brutalization and suppression of Edmonia Lewis, a Black student, in 1862.
