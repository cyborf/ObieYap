Boba with International Student and Scholar Service (ISSS) staff members.

Boba is a popular drink in Taiwan, where it originated from. It’s made of tapioca balls that are chewy and sweet. The tapioca balls are usually served in cold milk tea or fruit juice. There are many different flavors to choose from such as mango, strawberry, passionfruit, etc.

The ISSS office has been hosting boba events for the past few years. This year we had our first event on October 10th. We invited students who were interested in learning more about the ISSS office and its services. Students enjoyed their time at the event and learned about the resources available to them. They also got to meet other international students and make new friends!

Pizza at King Building

The King Building is a historic building located in the heart of downtown Oberlin, Ohio. It was built in 1870 and served as a hotel for many years before being converted into an office space in the early 20th century. The building has been renovated several times over the years to keep up with changing needs and trends. Today, it houses various businesses including restaurants, retail stores, professional offices, and residential apartments. The King Building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places due to its architectural significance as one of only two remaining buildings from Oberlin’s original commercial district that still stands today.

## History of King Building

The King Building is a historic landmark in Oberlin, Ohio. It was built in 1904 by John W. King and his son-in-law, Charles H. Smith. The building was originally used as a department store but later became home to various businesses such as banks, law firms, and insurance companies. In recent years it has been restored to its former glory with new tenants occupying the space including restaurants, boutiques, art galleries and more!

Promote Solarity this year, which features CupCakke as the main act.

Solarity is a student-run organization that promotes diversity and inclusion on campus through events such as concerts, workshops, and other activities. The event will take place at 9 p.m. in the Wilder Bowl.

“We are excited to bring CupcakKe to Oberlin for our first concert of the year,” said Solarity co-chairperson Katie Grossman ’20. “She has been an artist we have wanted to book since last year.”

The Chicago rapper’s music often deals with themes of sex positivity and female empowerment. She released her debut album, Audacious, in 2016. Her most recent release was Eden, which came out earlier this month.

Grossman added that she hopes students will come to the show because it is a great opportunity to see a rising star.

“I think people should come to the show because they can expect to hear some really good music from one of the best up-and-coming artists right now,” Grossman said. “It’ll be a fun time!”

In addition to CupcakKe, there will also be performances by local hip hop group MRC
