At 19, hooks began writing her book \"Ain't I a Woman\", published a decade later. bell hooks continued her higher education and eventually obtained a doctorate in English literature at the University of California, Santa Cruz. After that, she began her teaching career, which she considered to be the most powerful form of political resistance. Some of the schools she instructed were the University of Southern California, Yale University, and Oberlin College. Throughout her life, bell hooks wrote over 30 books and many scholarly articles before passing away on December 15, 2021.

{"input": "Feature former OSTA member Sarah Lariviere", "output": "This week we\u2019re shining a spotlight on former OSTA member and performer Sarah Lariviere! Sarah graduated from Oberlin in 1997 with a major in Theater, and a concentration in Acting. In addition to managing props for OSTA, she performed in several OSTA productions, including \u201cEquus\u201d directed by Greg Copeland \u201894, \u201cThe House of Blue Leaves\u201d directed by Rachel Claff \u201895, and \u201cThe Visit\u201d directed by Thomas Kriegsmann \u201898. Sarah became a social worker after graduation, working with kids and families for over a decade, and has been an author for the past decade. She credits her theatrical training as having helped in both of these areas; using listening skills and improv skills to keep clients engaged and connected in social work, and writing a book requires her to play the role of writer, actors, director, lighting designer, scenery designer, sound person, etc. Her new novel, Riot Act, comes out in July 2024 from Knopf: \u201cIt\u2019s an alternate history about theater kids fighting for freedom of expression in an authoritarian America. Theater was a lifeline for me, and continues to be, even indirectly.\u201d\n\nSarah had this to say about how her time working with OSTA has influenced her life and work: \u201cLearning to collaborate in service of something greater than myself, staying in the moment, trying not to bury my true feelings, or play life small. As an author, I have to be free to make bold, confident choices that are deeply emotionally connected to try to reach readers who want to feel something. That\u2019s acting, but it\u2019s also being authentic, in a big way. I\u2019m still practicing every day, trying to learn how to do that.\u201d"}

This class is in large part influenced by the work of Katy Pyle and the Ballez company and class in New York.

The play centers on 30-year-old Ty Green, a normal guy now faced with three very big problems. In an unprecedented run of promiscuity in the span of only a week, Ty manages to impregnate three women: his ex- girlfriend, his 40-something, married next-door neighbor, and his 18-year-old student. \"All This Intimacy\" distinctly attracted Bowman because of the comedy\u2019s absolute absurdity. Bowman wanted to explore how real people would navigate a normally unrealistic turn of events. If the director grounds the play in the each of the characters\u2019 realities than, as she states, it doesn\u2019t matter how absurd the situation is because the audience can find humanity through the humor. As the New York Times presents All This Intimacy it has a certain can\u2019t-look-away pull quality that poses the question: How would you face your own worst nightmare scenario?\n\ud83d\udcf7 Chris Schmuki\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#OberlinCollegeTheater #OberlinCollege"}

For theater artists, Zoom inhabits a space somewhere between live performance and digital recording that we are still in the process of mapping out. \n\nFor this production of Fires in the Mirror, we have embraced the unfortunately familiar aesthetic of Zoom as we perform in this uncharted territory. Performance on theZoom is neither live theater, nor is it fully edited filmmaking. Technology and slick production technique has rendered the artifice of realistic filmmaking invisible to the general public. Since Fires in the Mirror deals with issues of identity and subjective perspectives, in our design we have embraced artificiality and foregrounded the technology we are using for our production. Both the script and our design acknowledge that any performative re-creation of an historical event are necessarily distanced from an mediated for the viewer.\u201d \n- Jason Dorwart, Director of Fires in the Mirror\n\nRegister for Fires in the Mirror from the link in our bio!\n\nPictured above: Laura Carlson-Tarantowski renderings of the film's aesthetic"}

We invite you to join us this weekend (online or in your community) to take action and make our voices heard. We demand the defunding of the police. We demand an investment in Black communities. We demand the resignation of Donald Trump. We demand to be heard. While we celebrate Blackness and the joy of existing freely, we also are committed to the fight against limitations on our freedom.\n\nToday, we focus on investing in our futures. That means divesting from police and investing in our communities and our needs (education, affordable housing, jobs, etc). Tomorrow, we focus on the cost of inaction. Sunday, we focus on Trump\u2019s resignation. All of these themes fit into our SIX NINETEEN action weekend. We are actively organizing toward freedom.\n\nToday, we speak in one voice, in the names of those we have lost and the futures of those who would come after us. This, too, is democracy. Find ways to action virtually or in your community at sixnineteen.com.

Alvord grew up in a small town in New Mexico before studying social sciences at Dartmouth College. After graduating, she accepted a research position in New Mexico but was then encouraged to attend medical school. She enrolled at the University of New Mexico to complete her pre-med requirements, after which she applied to medical schools. Alvord was accepted into the Stanford University Medical School, received her M.D. in 1985, and achieved her board certification by 1994 as a surgeon, becoming the first Din\u00e9 woman to do so. She returned to the Navajo reservation in New Mexico to work in the community, where she learned that although she was able to remedy people via surgery, it was not enough to fully heal a person from their ills and often lacked the spiritual and psychological aspects of healing as well. She learned from the healers of her tribe that she must have a holistic perspective of medicine and work with the patients themselves to fully heal a person from their illness. In her book \u201cThe Scalpel and the Silver Bear,\u201d she writes about her experiences in combining Western medicine and traditional healing.

While she has a neurological condition that could suppress her immune system, she controls it with medication and is otherwise healthy. She contracted coronavirus disease 2019 back in April of 2020 and recounted her experience in an interview with Illinois Public Media. \nMayra went to the emergency room with low oxygen levels and was placed on a ventilator. What she thought would be a three-day stay turned into a six-week-long hell. She experienced nightmares, many involving her drowning, which she attributed to breathing difficulties. Mayra's family was told she might not even survive. But in June, the doctors suggested a life-saving measure: a double-lung transplant. Dr. Ankit Bharat, the Chief of Thoracic\nSurgery at Northwestern Medical, who operated on Mayra that month, said she was the sickest patient he has transplanted. Mayra was the first person to receive a double-lung transplant in the United States due to the virus. Since the operation, she is doing better but has to take various medications throughout the day to remain healthy. Mayra also faces at least a year of rehabilitation therapy before she can function independently.\"\n\nContinue reading in Issue 26 on our website.

At the beginning of the fall semester, in my weekly calls with my mom, I found that weather reports were no longer a delightful neutral ground of discussion but the new cause of sulky pauses and exasperated sighs. This fire season, California experienced the largest, most destructive fire in the state\u2019s history. As the president fails to address the root causes of the record-setting fires, just as he did with the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the United States (U.S.), I have directed my attention instead to the potential of bottom-up action by grassroots collectives and individuals to confront global crises. When the government does not provide clear guidance, what aids people in properly defending themselves and their community in the face of a global pandemic? Can this also be applied to help prompt action to prevent the destructive effects of climate change? \n\nContinue reading in Issue 26 on our website.

The Admissions Office works with a number of community-based organizations and programs that help us find amazing, talented students who might not otherwise be exposed to colleges like Oberlin.\u201d\n\nThe College has received a $500,000, five-year grant that will help expand into Houston and strengthen Oberlin\u2019s commitment to the program.

I\u2019m writing this to raise awareness of how this issue has polarized and disconnected the Oberlin community.\n\nIt has been a complex and difficult experience to exist as a Jewish person at Oberlin who strongly believes in and advocates for the freedom of the Palestinian people. I do not believe that complex and difficult experiences should be avoided. It is through this discomfort that we can all grow into the best versions of ourselves, able to hold nuanced and compassionate opinions.\n\nIn times of tragedy and loss, it is of the utmost importance that we support each other in our grief and acknowledge the collective suffering that we are experiencing. Oberlin is a community that emphasizes the importance of empathy and compassion as well as justice and activism. But have we been holding ourselves true to these ideals? I\u2019ve noticed that some of the activism that has been happening on campus lately does not seem to come from a space of compassion, and it is certainly not leading to any justice.\n\n\ud83d\udcf0Article by Andy Roshal \n\ud83d\udcf7Photo credits: Eloise Rich"}

Alvord grew up in a small town in New Mexico before studying social sciences at Dartmouth College. After graduating, she accepted a research position in New Mexico but was then encouraged to attend medical school. She enrolled at the University of New Mexico to complete her pre-med requirements, after which she applied to medical schools. Alvord was accepted into the Stanford University Medical School, received her M.D. in 1985, and achieved her board certification by 1994 as a surgeon, becoming the first Din\u00e9 woman to do so. She returned to the Navajo reservation in New Mexico to work in the community, where she learned that although she was able to remedy people via surgery, it was not enough to fully heal a person from their ills and often lacked the spiritual and psychological aspects of healing as well. She learned from the healers of her tribe that she must have a holistic perspective of medicine and work with the patients themselves to fully heal a person from their illness. In her book \u201cThe Scalpel and the Silver Bear,\u201d she writes about her experiences in combining Western medicine and traditional healing. OUR recognizes the amazing work of Lori Arviso Alvord and her contributions to medicine! \n#diversity #oberlin #OUR #research"}

You have food science to thank for that! Food science currently offers us exciting innovations that continue to better the quality of what we eat. However, food science suffers from an internal conflict: do we eat to live, or live to eat? In terms of science and its application to food, this means distinguishing between using science to improve food as a pragmatic product (e.g., through advancements in food safety, nutrition, and yield) and using it to improve the consumer's aesthetic experience of food (e.g., through improving the sensory and psychological experiences). This dilemma has been reflected in the development of breakfast cereal. However, breakfast cereals can also show us that food's aesthetic and pragmatic qualities are not always separate; the future of food science may even rely on merging these qualities. When one considers how food science has changed our relationship to food, especially in the case of breakfast cereal, the apparent split between the pragmatic and aesthetic diminishes, and the two categories can be seen intertwining and even merging.\"\n\nContinue reading in Issue 26 on our website.

Despite the pressing need for further research on this topic, scientific knowledge on this class of disorders remains largely unknown. A few disorders have known initial triggers and modes of pathogenesis that have been well-defined but most remain a mystery. As a result of this void in autoimmune neuropathy research, public awareness is lacking, pharmaceutical development is stunted, and patients are left in vulnerable positions with few treatment options and very little information about their conditions or, for that matter, validation of their pain.\" Continue reading in Issue 23 on our website.

Tommy graduated from Oberlin in 1998 with a double major in Theater and English, and a minor in Philosophy. While at Oberlin, he performed in \u201cCloud 9\u201d directed by David Walker \u201872, \u201cBent\u201d directed by Jeremy Cohen \u201895, and a devised dance-theater piece with local children directed by Nusha Martynuk. Tommy also directed \u201cAmerican Buffalo\u201d, \u201cThe Visit\u201d, \u201cWaiting for Godot\u201d, and was the co-director of an experimental troupe, /twelv/, with Max Truax \u201898. Tommy\u2019s company, ArKtype, began in 2005 and produces experimental multi-disciplinary work with major venues and festivals worldwide.

His Broadway debut ILLINOISE, a dance-theater adaptation of the Sufjan Stevens album by Jackie Sybblies Drury and Justin Peck, opens today at the St. James Theater and has already received Outer Critics and Drama League nominations, and he was shortlisted for an Oscar this year for Sam Green\u2019s live cinema documentary 32 SOUNDS with JD Samson.\n\nTommy had this to say about his time doing theater at Oberlin: \u201cAs an environment Oberlin was all about pushing for a unique vision - all of my pursuits since have sought developmental paths unique to the work\u2019s form. Caroline Jackson-Smith, Roger Copeland, and so many more lit up my world with essential languages of performance and their origins and that\u2019s guided my approach every step of the way. All of our experiments were done with essential support from OSTA.\u201d"}

The reliable supplies found along the Nile, the Euphrates, and the Ganges, were critical to the development of civilization. Yet, humanity famously forsook this precious resource during the industrial age, when decades of wanton pollution and development destroyed wetlands and rivers. The United States was no different, but it received a wake-up call when a brand new movement started talking about the environment, yelling about a 1969 fire on the Cuyahoga River. In 1972, 366 House Representatives and 75 Senators declared that they would no longer ignore the necessity of safe water supplies, and the Clean Water Act passed with a bipartisan supermajority. In response to critics who questioned the government\u2019s ability to afford the plan, the bill\u2019s sponsor, Edmund Muskie, asked, 'Can we afford life itself?'\n\nContinue reading on our website in Issue 25!

{"input": "Reflect on experiences with Oberlin's Gender, Sexuality, and Feminist Studies major", "output": "One of the reasons I was attracted to Oberlin was its Gender, Sexuality, and Feminist Studies major. I appreciated that I\u2019d be able to explore my interest in gender studies, and valued the interdisciplinary and intersectional nature of the major, which aims to center issues of sexuality, queerness, and race within gender. As someone interested in the specific experiences of Black and queer women, this was very exciting to me. Unfortunately the major was not as intersectional as I had hoped.\n\nMy first semester at Oberlin, I enrolled in a course called Introduction to Gender, Sexuality, and Feminist Studies. I examined the syllabus with an excited eye. The readings were from many of my favorite authors and intellectuals like Angela Davis, Bell Hooks, and June Jordan, along with an array of authors whose work I had not been exposed to. Despite the diversity emphasized in the course readings, I attended the class and was surprised to find that I was one of a handful of students of color in attendance.\n\nOver time I quickly noticed the impact that the racial makeup of the class had on student-led discussions. While analyzing systems of oppression was expected in classroom discussions, many students who were not POC discussed America\u2019s systems of oppression without race in mind. When referring to America\u2019s power system, which subjugates Brown, Black, impoverished, and queer people, students harshly critiqued the system, rarely acknowledging their own participation and place in upholding the system they critiqued. I remember a particular white student who would often remark on the amusingly cringey things white people would do. Afterward, many other white students in the class would agree and remarked on their own experiences of \u201cridiculous things white people would say.\u201d Click link in bio for more!\n\n\ud83d\udcf0Article by Avery Russell \n\ud83d\udcf7Photo credits: Abe Frato"}

Theatre is different there it is bold and experimental, and passionate. Seeing plays in another language showsus how we tell the story without words. It made me more aware of how we glean information from circumstances and behaviors. It stripped down theatre to just human beings, and how we understand each other when we don't understand the words. When creating work now, it is helpful to remember that and make sure to tell the story without leaning on language. Language, although important, is seldom the most important thing when it comes to telling a story in theatre.\u201d - Christine Impara \u201820, director of \u2018A Warsaw Melody\u2019.\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n#OberlinCollege #OberlinCollegeTheater"}

Braimah, who was born in Ghana and grew up in St. Louis, is not a percussionist \u2014 he plays only one instrument. His work collaborating with artists and teaching has aided in keeping the djembe tradition alive.\n\n\u201cOne of the first things Braimah] tells us is that if you\u2019re coming to this class to be in a drum circle or improve your rhythm and beat counting, this class is not for you,\u201d College fourth-year Chudi Martin Jr., who has been playing with the Djembe Orchestra since its inception, said. \u201cThe expectations, demands, and needs of this course are going to be drastically different.\u201d\n\nMany believe the origins of the djembe can be traced back to the 12th Century. Historians generally credit blacksmiths in the Malinke tribe of modern-day Mali for stretching the first rawhide across a djembe. As the empire of Mali expanded, and people migrated to modern-day Senegal, Mauritania, Guinea, and beyond, djembe music evolved and diversified. According to their descendants, the word djembe comes from the saying, \u201canke dj\u00e9, anke be,\u201d which means \u201ceveryone gather together in peace.\u201d This also defines the djembe\u2019s main purpose.\n\n\ud83d\udcf0Article by Nicolas Stebbins\n\ud83d\udcf7Photo credits: Erin Koo"}

At only 23 years old, she received her master\u2019s degree in Chemistry from the College of Hawaii! While teaching, she studied the compounds of chaulmoogra oil and was able to derive its healing compounds into an injectable form that would alleviate the symptoms of leprosy. Recently after discovering this treatment, however, Ball passed away from accidentally inhaling chlorine gas and was not able to see the extent of her discovery. Furthermore, credit for her discovery was stolen, and it was not until recently that the first treatment for Hansen\u2019s disease was credited to her. We remember Alice Ball\u2019s legacy in creating a viable treatment for Hansen\u2019s disease and her excellence in research!\n\n#diversity #oberlin #research #legacy"}

The celebrations continued year after year.\n.\n.\n It\u2019s important to note that, Juneteenth isn\u2019t a straightforward story of emancipation, nor did it necessarily improve conditions for many African Americans the next day or even the next decade. \n  Erin Stewart Mauldin said \u201cJuneteenth is neither the beginning nor the end of something. The end of the Civil War and the ending of slavery didn\u2019t happen overnight and was a lot more like a jagged edge than a clean cut.\u201d\n.\n.\nOn that note, do your own research on Juneteenth and learn the history. Don\u2019t forget to come out tomorrow, June 18th for the Juneteenth block party with ABUSUA! \n\nSource: \nhttps://www.stpetersburg.usf.edu/news/2021/juneteenth-complicated-history-significance-celebration-around-struggle-for-freedom.aspx"}

The firm claimed to have acquired them from computer drives that were maintained and accessed by several University of Michigan coaches. Soon after, the Big Ten opened a sign-stealing investigation into Michigan, with Michigan staffer Connor Stalions being the ringleader of the operation.\n\nStalions was originally a volunteer assistant in 2015, but officially became part of their staff in 2022. A Michigan native, his parents both went to University of Michigan. Stalions played football throughout his childhood and his dad was a football coach for an eighth grade team. He graduated from the Naval academy in 2017, where he worked as a volunteer football assistant during his undergraduate years. He also wrote a 550\u2013600 page document called the Michigan Manifesto that he managed daily, which outlined his 15-year blueprint for taking over the University of Michigan Football program and becoming head coach. Stalions is suspended with pay from his role for the Wolverines due to sign-stealing allegations.\n\n\ud83d\udcf0Article by Andrea Nguyen and Micah Rodriguez\n\ud83d\udcf7Photo courtesy of Norm Hall"}

I really value the way my time abroad in Moscow supplemented my approach to acting, and my history major has been deeply skewed towards Eastern Europe and specifically Russia. This play allows me to wrap all of that together with everything I\u2019ve learned from the theater faculty. \u2018A Warsaw Melody\u2019 is such an ensemble piece, I\u2019ve loved working with Connor, he\u2019s so committed and earnestly connected to the work, and Christine and I have taken (truly) every acting class together short of 100 our freshman year, so it\u2019s really easy for us to communicate about the process. The play is cinematic and thoughtful and really wistfully beautiful; a perfect capture of love in the Soviet Union.- Casey Labbate \u201820 \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n#OberlinCollege #OberlinCollegeTheater"}

Doing geology research in context to building computer programs allowed me to develop a deeper understanding of both fields. Once I figured out what I wanted to do with my life I started looking into graduate school programs for geology, something that as a computer science major I didn't really have to do because it\u2019s a little easier to get a job in. What\u2019s really unique about research at Oberlin as an undergrad is that  we have a small team so we go out and collect the samples that we want. At other institutions it\u2019s just a lot of research without the field work experience and I think the field work experience is one of the most valuable parts of geology. Having research experience prior to my first year helped me navigate my first year, it taught me to pick apart big projects, how to work as a team and that I was able to rely on other people and not just myself.\n\n\ud835\udc7e\ud835\udc89\ud835\udc82\ud835\udc95 \ud835\udc8a\ud835\udc94 \ud835\udc94\ud835\udc90\ud835\udc8e\ud835\udc86\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc89\ud835\udc8a\ud835\udc8f\ud835\udc88 \ud835\udc8a\ud835\udc8e\ud835\udc91\ud835\udc90\ud835\udc93\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc82\ud835\udc8f\ud835\udc95 \ud835\udc9a\ud835\udc90\ud835\udc96 \ud835\udc89\ud835\udc82\ud835\udc97\ud835\udc86 \ud835\udc8d\ud835\udc86\ud835\udc82\ud835\udc93\ud835\udc8f\ud835\udc86\ud835\udc85 \ud835\udc87\ud835\udc93\ud835\udc90\ud835\udc8e \ud835\udc9a\ud835\udc90\ud835\udc96\ud835\udc93 \ud835\udc8e\ud835\udc86\ud835\udc8f\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc90\ud835\udc93?\nAmanda has taught me many things. She\u2019s one of the top people in her field and she\u2019s published so many papers it\u2019s insane. She taught me that it\u2019s ok to mess up and fail and its ok to have lots of works in progress. She gives me the freedom to finish my task at my own pace. She believes in my ability to get things done and she\u2019s constantly reassuring me that I\u2019m doing good. She\u2019s just a really amazing person.\n\n#researchers #geology #oberlincollege #undergrad"}

The important work of M4BL, the #metoo movement, an increasing awareness of the breadth of gender identities and Queer folks in our culture, and centuries overdue justice for Black, Indigenous, and People of Color, all REQUIRE that movement forward in this time reflect a genuine commitment to social justice. These questions arise in every area of what we do. Whether it's a question of programming plays that reflect the breadth of who we are, or how to create safe places in which to make our work without replicating the trauma we seek to expose and eradicate, our conscious effort must forever be to MAKE the world we wish to occupy.\n\nThis panel discussion will focus on a case study. Even as the #metoo movement was first signalling the urgency of protections for Women and Femme identities, and as Black Lives Matter was raising awareness of gross injustices, several members of the Cleveland Theater Community began to assemble a model for working: The CLEan House Document. In the midst of its roll-out, the pandemic forced closure of theaters across the greater Cleveland area. We will focus our discussion on the origins of that document, the progress made, and how it's evolved during the big pause. Joining us will be:\n\nNathan Motta: Artistic Director of Dobama Theater and one of the original drafters of the CLEan House Document\nColin Anderson: General Manager of Dobama Theater and vocal advocate for the LGBTQIA+ community\nNina Domingue-Glover: Award winning Actress, Director and Writer and original drafter of the CLEan House Document\nNicole Sumlin: Award winning Actress and Activist and inspiration for the CLEan House Document."}

The driver with the most points, earned from their finishing position in the race, is crowned the Drivers\u2019 World Champion at the end of the season, and the team with the most points, earned from the combined finishing position of both cars, is crowned the Constructors\u2019 World Champion.\n\nThe finale in Abu Dhabi put an end to a season that saw many longstanding records shattered, a third Drivers\u2019 Championship for Dutch driver Max Verstappen, and a sixth Constructors\u2019 Championship for his team, Red Bull Racing. \n\nThe combination of Verstappen and Red Bull\u2019s RB-19 car proved dominant throughout the year. The Dutch driver claimed 19 wins out of the 22 races this season, with his Red Bull teammate Sergio Perez claiming two, bringing the team\u2019s total to 21 wins. The only race Red Bull lost was the Singapore Grand Prix, where Ferrari\u2019s Carlos Sainz became the sole non-Red Bull driver to stand atop the podium.\n\n\ud83d\udcf0Article by Karthik Ranganadhan\n\ud83d\udcf7Photo credits: Erin Koo"}

{"input": "Discuss racism as a public health crisis", "output": "\"Racism has officially been declared a public health crisis in several states and counties, including Lorain County, Ohio. On a societal level, racism has led to inequalities that permeate all spheres of life, from education to incarceration. Sparked by the deaths of Ahmad Arbery, Breonna Taylor, George Floyd, and countless other individuals, many have began to rise up against the systemic racism that pervades our society. This new wave of activism and the resurgence of the Black Lives Matter movement was brought on by police brutality, the unjust murder of Black people, and increased national attention on the experience of African Americans within our society. News and social media can help us see the effects of racism on individuals and groups, but it can be harder to tell how racism affects people on a microscopic level, at their individual biological experience.

(Actually, my first experience with this play, The Misanthrope, was through a recorded audio performance that I found in my town\u2019s public library\u2014in my far-gone youth!) The great positive of performing this play this semester is that our actors\u2014a truly wonderful ensemble drawn from all three on-campus classes\u2014must focus on performing with their voices, still using all the tools of a fine actor to get to the ultimate expression of their characters, but in an audio world.\u201d\n\nAnd, don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not too late to register.

She graduated from her high school class as valedictorian and received a full ride to Virginia State University. She graduated from college in 1952 with a degree in mathematics. She then taught math and science courses before returning to Virginia State to complete a Masters of Mathematics in 1955. After graduating, West was hired to work at the Naval Proving Ground, located in Dahlgren, Virginia. During her early time there, she was involved as a computer programmer and managed data processing systems. West was one of the only Black employees, and was the second Black woman to work there. Simultaneously, she earned a second master\u2019s in public administration. In 1960, West participated in groundbreaking research that proved Pluto\u2019s motion relative to Neptune\u2019s. After this, she began working with data from satellites. In the 1980s, West programmed calculations to model the shape of the Earth. Her designs were the basis of the modern GPS system. She retired in 1998, and received a PhD in public administration after retiring. She was inducted into the US Air Force Hall of Fame in 2018. OUR honors the great work that Gladys West has done, and the dedication she demonstrated to her field. #OUR #research #oberlin #diversity"}
