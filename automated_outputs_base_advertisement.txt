Boba with International Student and Scholar Service (ISSS) staff members

Boba is a popular Taiwanese drink that has become increasingly popular in the United States. It‚Äôs made of tapioca balls, milk tea, and sugar. The tapioca balls are chewy and have a unique texture. They can be eaten by themselves or added to other drinks like coffee or smoothies.

The first time I tried boba was when my friend brought me some from her hometown in China. She said it was very common there but not so much here in America. When she told me about how delicious they were, I couldn‚Äôt wait to try them myself! So we went out together one night after class and got ourselves some bubble tea at our favorite spot near campus. We both loved it right away ‚Äì especially since ours came with extra-large straws so we could suck up all those little pearls without having any trouble getting them down our throats üôÇ

## What Is Boba?

Boba is a type of tea that originated in Taiwan. It consists of small balls made from tapioca starch, which are then cooked until they become soft and chewy. These balls are usually served with milk or fruit juice as well as ice cream on top.

Pizza at 1PM Monday?

I‚Äôm not sure if I should be proud of myself or ashamed. It was a good pizza, but it wasn‚Äôt the best pizza in town. And I had to walk past two other places that serve better pizza on my way home from work. But I didn‚Äôt care. I wanted pizza and I got it.

It was a nice day out so I decided to eat outside. The place is called ‚ÄúPizzeria Uno‚Äù and they have a patio with tables and chairs. There were only three people there when I arrived. One guy eating alone, one couple sitting together, and me.

The menu has all kinds of pizzas listed by number. They also offer salads, sandwiches, and desserts. I ordered #20 which is a pepperoni pizza with mushrooms and green peppers. It came with a side salad.

When I asked for extra cheese, she said no problem. She then added some more sauce to the top of the pie before putting it into the oven. After about ten minutes, she brought it back out and cut it up into eight slices. Then she put it onto a plate and handed it over to me.

Professor Beer at the 'Sco by Economics Department

The Economics Department hosted a talk on Thursday, April 12th with Professor Robert Beer from the University of California, Santa Barbara. The event was held in the ‚ÄòSco and was attended by students and faculty members alike.

Professor Beer‚Äôs research focuses on the economics of education, labor markets, and public policy. He has published articles in leading academic journals such as the American Economic Review, Journal of Political Economy, Quarterly Journal of Economics, and Journal of Labor Economics. His current work examines the effects of school choice programs on student achievement, teacher quality, and segregation; the impact of college financial aid policies on educational attainment; and the role of social networks in shaping career outcomes.

During his visit to UC Berkeley, Professor Beer gave an informal presentation about his research on the effects of school choice programs on student achievement. In particular, he discussed how these programs can help improve educational outcomes for low-income students.

After the presentation, there was a Q&A session where students had the opportunity to ask questions about Professor Beer‚Äôs research and get advice on pursuing careers in academia or consulting. Overall, it was

The next meeting of the UW-Madison chapter of the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (ASBMB) will be held in room 205 of the King Building on Monday, November 3rd from 1:00 to 2:00 PM. The speaker is Dr. David G. Nelson, Professor of Chemistry and Biomolecular Chemistry at UW-Madison. His talk is entitled ‚ÄúChemical Biology of Protein Folding.‚Äù

Abstract:
Proteins are essential components of all living organisms. They carry out a wide range of functions including catalysis, transport, signaling, structural support, and regulation. In order to perform these diverse roles, proteins must fold into their native structures with high fidelity. This process is often referred to as protein folding. However, this term can be misleading because it implies that there is only one structure that a given polypeptide chain can adopt. In fact, many proteins have multiple stable conformations, some of which may be biologically relevant while others may not. Furthermore, proteins do not always fold correctly. For example, mutations or other perturbations can
