Students work with four college mentors and the foundation to secure internships and career opportunities throughout the year. At Oberlin, the Posse Foundation has recruited their students exclusively from Chicago, but recently, Oberlin has announced the expansion of the program to recruit from Houston as well. The first Posse Scholars from Houston will begin studies alongside the 19th Chicago cohort. \\n\\n“We are proud of our long and productive history with the Posse Foundation, and we will recruit Chicago Posse #18 this year,” Manuel Carballo, vice president and dean of Admissions and Financial Aid, wrote in an email to the Review. “We recruited our first Posse cohort in 2006 and have welcomed more than 170 Posse Scholars to campus since then. The Admissions Office works with a number of community-based organizations and programs that help us find amazing, talented students who might not otherwise be exposed to colleges like Oberlin.”\\n\\nThe College has received a $500,000, five-year grant that will help expand into Houston and strengthen Oberlin’s commitment to the program. This will allow for 10 students to be selected from both Houston and Chicago, with the process starting in December 2024. There are currently four Chicago Posse cohorts on campus, with the 18th group being recruited this year. The goal is to add eight mentors and four cohorts from Houston by 2028.\\n\\n📰Article by Nikki Keating\\n📷Photo courtesy of Scott Shaw',\n",

An area that looked and felt different from the rest of their rooms so it was easy to distinguish between a work environment and a home environment. \\n\\nIn order to achieve that each space, regardless of if they share some characteristics, is unique in layout and setup, and a lot of the time have been expanded with items from the dancers personal collections. Each set and costume is inspired by the dancer's unique characters they created with the lighting and color pallete acting as a unifying element.“\\n\\nTo see more of Homer-Drummond’s initial design concepts, head over to @bigbadspender.\\n\\nSeen above: a collage of the initial design board for Big Spender’s costume design.\\n\\nYou can register NOW to see Big Spender which will be available to watch February 19 - 21 at the link in our bio.\",\n",

Impacts of sexual violence: Disconnect with spirit, culture, or self. Physical injury - lasting short or long term. Trauma, hyper-vigilance, flashbacks. Difficulty trusting or believing others. Entire medicine wheel: spiritual, physical, emotional, mental. \\n\\n2) Sexual violence is pervasive. American Indians are 2.5 times more likely to experience sexual assault compared to all other races. 34% of Native women are raped in their lifetimes. At least 84% of perpetrators of these crimes are non-Native men. \\n\\n3) Sexual violence and trauma. Following an assault, common outcomes include poor mental health (PTSD, acute stress disorders, depression, sleep disorders, anxiety, suicidal ideation). Decreased sexual urges/pleasure, increased sexual risk behaviors, substance use and physical health problems. Revitalization (is) also commonly reported for Indigenous survivors of childhood sexual abuse. \\n\\n4) Sexual Violence is Preventable. Protective factors positively associated with health and social outcomes for American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) youth include: Personal wellness, positive self-image, self-efficacy, familial and non-familial connectedness, positive opportunities, positive social norms, cultural connectedness.',\n",

Theatre is how I create an institutional memory for my community, and one filled with joy and love as well as pain and perseverance.

Often responsible for the propagation of chronic symptoms including fatigue, nausea, and chronic pain, autoimmune neuropathy is an increasingly important area of research. Despite the pressing need for further research on this topic, scientific knowledge on this class of disorders remains largely unknown. A few disorders have known initial triggers and modes of pathogenesis that have been well-defined but most remain a mystery. As a result of this void in autoimmune neuropathy research, public awareness is lacking, pharmaceutical development is stunted, and patients are left in vulnerable positions with few treatment options and very little information about their conditions or, for that matter, validation of their pain.\"\\n\\nContinue reading in Issue 23 on our website.

At 19, hooks began writing her book \"Ain\\'t I a Woman\", published a decade later. bell hooks continued her higher education and eventually obtained a doctorate in English literature at the University of California, Santa Cruz. After that, she began her teaching career, which she considered to be the most powerful form of political resistance.

Throughout her life, bell hooks wrote over 30 books and many scholarly articles before passing away on December 15, 2021.

       "   'output': '\"Have you ever wandered down the cereal aisle, at a loss for words at the bounty of different varieties and flavors? You have food science to thank for that! Food science currently offers us exciting innovations that continue to better the quality of what we eat. However, food science suffers from an internal conflict: do we eat to live, or live to eat? In terms of science and its application to food, this means distinguishing between using science to improve food as a pragmatic product (e.g., through advancements in food safety, nutrition, and yield) and using it to improve the consumer\\'s aesthetic experience of food (e.g., through improving the sensory and psychological experiences). This dilemma has been reflected in the development of breakfast cereal. However, breakfast cereals can also show us that food\\'s aesthetic and pragmatic qualities are not always separate; the future of food science may even rely on merging these qualities.

Doing geology research in context to building computer programs allowed me to develop a deeper understanding of both fields. Once I figured out what I wanted to do with my life I started looking into graduate school programs for geology, something that as a computer science major I didn't really have to do because it’s a little easier to get a job in. What’s really unique about research at Oberlin as an undergrad is that  we have a small team so we go out and collect the samples that we want. At other institutions it’s just a lot of research without the field work experience and I think the field work experience is one of the most valuable parts of geology. Having research experience prior to my first year helped me navigate my first year, it taught me to pick apart big projects, how to work as a team and that I was able to rely on other people and not just myself.\\n\\n𝑾𝒉𝒂𝒕 𝒊𝒔 𝒔𝒐𝒎𝒆𝒕𝒉𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝒊𝒎𝒑𝒐𝒓𝒕𝒂𝒏𝒕 𝒚𝒐𝒖 𝒉𝒂𝒗𝒆 𝒍𝒆𝒂𝒓𝒏𝒆𝒅 𝒇𝒓𝒐𝒎 𝒚𝒐𝒖𝒓 𝒎𝒆𝒏𝒕𝒐𝒓?\\nAmanda has taught me many things. She’s one of the top people in her field and she’s published so many papers it’s insane. She taught me that it’s ok to mess up and fail and its ok to have lots of works in progress. She gives me the freedom to finish my task at my own pace. She believes in my ability to get things done and she’s constantly reassuring me that I’m doing good. She’s just a really amazing person.\\n\\n#researchers #geology #oberlincollege #undergrad\",\n",

Images of broad-shouldered, well defined, and spray-tanned individuals holding a gallon jug of water probably come to mind. The science behind how those individuals came to look that way — and why they are carrying a gallon of water — is quite fascinating. Our understanding of what is required to achieve this hypermuscular state reaches down to the cellular level. Those who participate in bodybuilding must manipulate multiple metabolic pathways to achieve their desired result. The universal practice in this sport involves following a distinct diet combined with strenuous physical activity in order to minimize body fat and maximize muscle tissue. The Merriam Webster Dictionary defines bodybuilding as “the developing of the body through exercise and diet.” If bodybuilding was easy, then many more individuals would try to participate. It requires a substantial amount of discipline and mental strength. Critics may ask, “why going through such a rigorous diet and exercise routine is worth competing?” For those who make it to the professional level, the top placements receive prize money, and for many, the experience of winning is a compelling enough reason to continue.\"\\n\\nContinue reading in Issue 26 on our website.

       "   'output': 'Roseli Ocampo-Friedmann was a Filipino-American microbiologist and botanist, specializing in cyanobacteria and extremophiles. Ocampo-Friedmann was born in Manila, Philippines and obtained a degree in botany from the University of the Philippines in 1958. She then completed her master’s at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem before returning to the Philippines to work. In 1973, she obtained a PhD at Florida State University. Ocampo-Friedmann and her husband often traveled to conduct research on algae and microorganisms. In particular, their trip to the Dry Valleys located in Antarctica was groundbreaking. The Dry Valleys are devoid of ice and snow and are characterized by their low humidity, so when the couple found microorganisms, now known as cryptoendoliths, living within the rock under extreme conditions, this discovery has implications for life in extreme environments. The couple successfully grew a culture of these microorganisms in a laboratory, and after writing a paper highlighting their discovery, their research supported the theory of the possibility of life on Mars. OUR recognizes the significant contributions of Roseli Ocampo-Friedmann in enhancing our understanding of life on Earth and beyond!\\n#diversity #oberlin #OUR #research #AAPIHeritageMonth',\n",

Her experience with cats spans approximately 20 years, and her initial interest was sparked when a cat was killed in front of her house. \\n\\n“We discovered that she had kittens,” Burgess said. “I wanted to take them, so I learned how to raise them just by working with [my vet].” \\n\\nToday, she raises approximately 75–100 kittens a year, a handful of them only a couple days old and half of them unweaned. During the day, these kittens live in the Ginko Gallery & Studio, where students and community members can visit and spend time with them, helping to socialize them. \\n\\n“That’s the only difference between a feral cat and a domestic cat, whether they’ve had a good experience with humans in that first eight weeks of their life,” Burgess said. “Otherwise, they’re basically a wild animal.” Click link in bio for more!\\n\\n📰Article by Sydney Collinger\\n📷Photo credits: Eloise Rich',\n",

The firm claimed to have acquired them from computer drives that were maintained and accessed by several University of Michigan coaches.

He graduated from the Naval academy in 2017, where he worked as a volunteer football assistant during his undergraduate years. He also wrote a 550–600 page document called the Michigan Manifesto that he managed daily, which outlined his 15-year blueprint for taking over the University of Michigan Football program and becoming head coach.

There has been a recent (and very tragic) death in my family and I have resettled permanently  for emotional support. I also accepted an offer for an inaugural role as the director of diversity, equity, and inclusion for the Southern California Institute of Architecture.\\nI have grown tremendously in the director role over the last two years and hope that I have helped further Oberlin’s commitment to increased belonging and persistence for BIPOC and LGBTQ+ students.\\nI am deeply proud of the ways that we have committed and recommitted ourselves to standing up for each other. This includes your voluntary participation in new MRC workshops on allyship and disrupting anti-Blackness; faculty and staff participation in the Intergroup Dialogues on Race Talk; your sharing our digital resources on antiracism and mental health for BIPOC people; attending mental health roundtables and community welcomes, and even taking a break from a tense election season to de-stress with Obie pets.\\nBut I am most proud of how we have shown up for each other during one of the most difficult and relentless times in human history. This pandemic has pushed us to the depths of ourselves, and we’re still here. Still committed. Still growing. Still possessing the audacity to stunt.\\nAll MRC programs will continue as planned for the remainder of the spring semester with increased support from staff within the Division of Student Life.\\nI have so much gratitude for past and present members of the Legendary Team MRC and the students, staff, and faculty whom I have gotten to know on a professional and personal level during my tenure.\\nStay up,\\nZahida\\n_\\nPhoto Credit: Jose Barrera ‘20',\n",

Commits to divestment from the Israeli occupation of Palestine, as per the divestment proposal submitted earlier this month.\\n\\nOberlin College maintains moral and material complicity in the ongoing genocide of the Palestinian people. As such, we act in steadfast solidarity with Palestine and with students across the country to demand that the administration and the board of trustees examine Oberlin’s financial link to war, oppression, and exploitation. As people of conscience , with our eyes on Gaza, we affirm that none of us are free until all of us are free.\\n\\nIt took ten years of student activism, including the construction of an encampment, for Oberlin to finally agree to divest from institutions and corporations complicit in South African apartheid. Oberlin demonstrated both its willingness to take a moral stand and its ability to screen investments with its divestment from fossil fuels. It has now been 75 years since the Nakba of 1948. The state of Israel has been found to plausibly be committing genocide by the International Criminal Justice Court and has ignored calls from the U.N. Security Council for an immediate ceasefire.\\n\\nOberlin’s website asserts: “In accordance with Oberlin’s history of action in response to ‘instances of human suffering, natural calamity, and injustice,’ the Board will consider proposals for divestment from entities that contribute to activities that ‘shock the conscience.’” The conscience of the Oberlin community is beyond shocked. And that shock compels us to act.\\n\\nWe will build community around education, advocacy, and solidarity through robust programming, including:\\nVigils, Poetry and Literature Readings, Art Builds, Teach-Ins, and more',\n",

It is our belief that Black students and community members are entitled to feel safe and welcome at the ‘Sco, and we must take every possible step to realize this right. \\nTherefore, we unequivocally reject the cultures of racial segregation, exclusion, and erasure that have plagued The ‘Sco in the past.

Ultimately, we challenge all non-Black members of our community to actively engage in the fight to realize the full potential of our space. As we work through this process, we must each reflect on our relationship to both The ‘Sco and the broader community. In doing so, we will learn from our mistakes and hold one another accountable in the future. \\nWe need to reconcile ourselves if we are to be who we claim, and we need to be who we claim if we are to survive and love.

       "   'output': 'This week for Oberlin\\'s Black History Month, OUR is celebrating the life and legacy of Zora Neale Hurston. A renowned novelist, anthropologist, folklorist, and filmmaker, Hurston\\'s ethnographic research often contributed to the depth of her literary works. Hurston was born in Notasulga, Alabama, on January 7, 1891, but her family moved to Eatonville, Florida, shortly after, a place that would inspire many of her later works. Hurston attended Howard University and then Barnard College, where she received a B.A. in anthropology in 1928. Hurston traveled through the American South and the Caribbean, documenting Black folklore, publishing her work of literary anthropology, \"Mules and Men\", in 1935. At the same time, Hurston was a leading figure of the Harlem Renaissance, working with Langston Hughes and Wallace Thurman. Many of her literary works discussed issues in Black communities and her struggles as a Black woman. In 1937, Hurston\\'s notable novel, \"Their Eyes Were Watching God\", was published. Throughout the 1940s and 50s, Hurston published works in periodicals. On January 28, 1960, Zora Neale Hurston passed away. OUR recognizes Hurston\\'s incredible contributions to the humanities, and her work is invaluable in documenting the intricacies and nuances of Black experiences. #BlackHistoryMonth #diversity #oberlin #our',\n",

       "   'output': 'Today\\'s underrepresented researcher for Black History Month is Francis Cecil Sumner, also known as the \"Father of Black Psychology\". Born in 1895 in Arkansas, Sumner received a homeschooled education as the educational resources for Black students was lacking. At 15, he was admitted to Lincoln College after taking an entrance exam. In 1915, he graduated with a degree in philosophy. Sumner then began attending Clark University in 1916 to attain a second degree in English. Soon after, he returned to Lincoln College to start his graduate studies in psychology but was interrupted when he was drafted during World War I. When he returned, he completed his dissertation, \"Psychoanalysis of Freud and Adler,\" and he became the first Black person to attain a PhD in Psychology. After his graduate studies, Sumner focused on \"race psychology\", specifically investigating the racial biases in psychology that resulted in theories claiming that African Americans were inferior. Sumner had difficulties receiving funding for his research throughout his career due to racial discrimination. The most extended position he held was the Chair of the Psychology Department at Howard University from 1928 to 1954. During that time, he established many reforms, the biggest being the Psychology Department\\'s separation from the Philosophy Department. After accomplishing much successful work in many fields, Francis Cecil Sumner passed away in 1954. We recognize the great strides of Francis Cecil Sumner in the field of psychology and paving the way for future Black psychologists!\\n#diversity #oberlin #research #OUR #BlackHistoryMonth',\n",

However, there was no ultimate agreement reached among news organizations concerning the cause of the explosion, and further analysis has called into question key evidence cited by Israeli intelligence, leaving the source of the explosion unclear.\\n\\nThe article additionally states that, “recent evidence suggests a misfired rocket was destroyed by Israel’s Iron Dome defense system in the immediate vicinity of the hospital.” While there has been speculation about the role of the Iron Dome in intercepting the rocket, recent evidence regarding this claim is inconclusive.\\n \\nThe Oberlin Review’s intention is to report the news factually and in good faith.

Chen’s sound practice is concerned with the materiality/physicality of sound and its relationship to the human body. Her music features analogue modular synthesizers, vinyl/resin records, and self-built electronics. She is famous for her “needle nails”; modified acrylic fingernails with embedded turntable needles, allowing her to play up to five grooves of a record at once. Her close collaborator Aaron Dilloway is one of the most creative, prolific, and revered figures in the Midwest American experimental/noise scene. His performances and recordings incorporate rhythmic loops from eight-track tapes, vocal improvisations, found sounds, and field recordings. He uses contact microphones in order to generate harsh, feedback-laced noises, sometimes placing microphones inside his mouth in order to create bizarre, ogre-like distorted voices. Evichsen and Aaron will be playing a collaborative noise set, with openers Fae and Penina playing an instrument of their own invention called “String Thing #2” THURSDAY May 9th at the ‘sco, doors at 9:30, free with OCID! $10 for non-students',\n",

Over the coming weeks we want to reflect on our outstanding and expansive 2019-2020 season. \\nFirst up is our season opener \"But Never Doubt I Love\". Using Shakespeare’s original text, translated German Art Song, and modern mediums, Marina Wright’s ‘20 one-woman show, “But Never Doubt I Love”, reconsidered one of Shakespeare’s most famous characters: Hamlet. It began with Wright, as Hamlet, in the middle of crisis: coping with the loss of his father, trying to comprehend his mother’s lack of faithfulness, and grappling with his uncle’s rise to the throne. Hamlet’s inner and outer worlds are in turmoil. The show effectively investigated Hamlet’s mental state, exploring how both anxiety and depression affect him and his relationship to the women in his life.\\n\\nExcellently balancing her classical vocal training from the Conservatory and her Shakespearean technique gained through the Theater Department, Wright’s one-woman show, “But Never Doubt I Love”, was the perfect culmination of Wright’s 5 years here at Oberlin.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n#OberlinTheater\\xa0#OberlinCollege',\n",

The musical also highlights the financial, moral, and ethical bankruptcy that the endless consumerism of our culture can lead us to. Central to the musical are the ways that corporate greed has, and will continue to, commodify and deplete our natural resources.\\n\\nIn this country today, where more than half of the citizens deny that the very real consequences of climate change will personally affect them, Wright asserts, “We need art that inspires action.” Through humor, Urinetown allows the audience to critically interrogate the pressing fears of our present climate crisis. “Though the play makes a joke of this essential human crisis,” Wright notes, “the intent is that we laugh at it derisively and thoughtfully and, perhaps, with more than a modicum of actual terror.”\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n#OberlinCollegeTheater\\xa0#OberlinCollege',\n",

       "   'output': 'On Friday, Nov. 3, I walked into Warner Main and sat down on the crowded mats in front of the bleachers. I was there to see Fall Forward, the annual performance put on by the Oberlin College Dance department. Before I walked into the show, one of my friends told me that there was a controversy about a half-hour senior dance piece that was part of the program for the night. It was about whether or not a piece that took up three dance slots in the show should have been allowed or whether it should have been its own show entirely, as often happens with senior projects. I don’t know what prompted this piece to be placed in Fall Forward, but I’m very glad it was. I am referring to “Patient 6183,” choreographed by College fourth-year Liz Hawk.\\n\\nThe dance used multiple actors to represent the people in the story, even having them represent different versions of the same character. It used spoken word as well as dance to tell the story of a child who is diagnosed with severe scoliosis and consequently spends their whole life facing the fallout of it. The piece opens with a row of people in lab coats surrounding a bed occupied by a single person. The “doctors” begin listing the conditions of the patient, speaking over each other until the words are unintelligible \\xad— a mess of medical jargon. Then the person on the bed uses their own voice to tell the audience “how fucked up I am.” This set the tone for the whole piece, and simultaneously made me sit up and pay attention.\\n\\nI was diagnosed with a rare bone condition when I was seven years old. As a result of that, I have spent most of my life in and out of hospitals. I was subsequently diagnosed with several other exciting things like Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome — as fun as it sounds — and scoliosis — though not as bad as that of the subject of the dance. At this point I am well and able-bodied, but that makes me a medical anomaly and a fascination of doctors. I remember being so proud that the medical student assisting with my care wrote a paper about me when I was eight.....

Eating is a biological necessity for survival and, at the same time, arguably one of life’s greatest pleasures.

The timelines put forth vary wildly — in late 2020, some politicians claimed a vaccine would be available to everyone within the year, while many doctors and public health officials estimated it would take until 2021 or 2022. Vaccine development consists of lengthy stages and usually takes 10 to 15 years, but the coronavirus disease has spurred a massive effort to speed up the process. Lockdown measures in the United States (U.S.) have been sporadic and insufficient. With cases rising quickly, a vaccine might be the only way to end this pandemic.

Amidst the general unrest of 2020, politicians in the midst of heated discourse fueled by misinformation once again failed to adequately address the realities of catastrophic wildfires in the West. Every year, wildfires rage across North American wildlands, reigniting a highly politicized debate in the United States (U.S.) about the relationship between climate change and wildfire season. Climate change is not the reason there are wildfires in the United States, or anywhere for that matter. Periodic wildfires are essential to the natural cycles of many ecosystems around the world. What is concerning about recent wildfire seasons is the increased prevalence of large wildfires that often burn with greater intensity. Overwhelming evidence indicates that climate change is responsible for this trend. As this is likely to continue, a major shift in wildfire policy is necessary to mitigate the devastating ecological and socioeconomic impacts on the western U.S.\"\\n\\nContinue reading in Issue 27.

       "   'output': 'In the most diverse city in the nation, Kenton Place has cemented their place as a unique voice among the rest of the Houston, Texas music scene. Blending hard rock and metal sounds of the past with a contemporary style, Kenton Place is bringing a much-needed heavy rock revival to the 2020’s. Logan Smalley (vocals, rhythm guitar), Noe Hernandez (drums), Roque Techera (lead guitar), and Curtis Bird (bass) have transformed their childhood friendship into a musical machine that is constantly running and brings new meaning to the phrase ‘rock ‘n roll’. Not all bands have their members actively pursuing degrees in financial planning, graphic design, law, double bass, and environmental studies, but these guys do it all. Through all the study sessions and challenging exams, Kenton Place powers through, working with industry leads such as: Grammy Award-nominated producer Ulrich Wild (Pantera, Breaking Benjamin, Deftones, and Slipknot); Grammy Award-winning Ted Jensen (Evanescence, Green Day, Billy Joel, and Norah Jones); Ken Stringfellow (The Posies, REM); and Derrick McKinney, founder and CEO of L.O.U.D. Muzik. Their act has graced the stages of world-famous venues such as the House of Blues and White Oak Music Hall in Houston, and the SXSW Austin Showcase. Their music has been featured on Houston’s premier rock station 94.5 The Buzz. And the one thing uniting all these showstopping opportunities and relationships: an unfettered passion to love and share music with their audience.',\n",

We're looking at patterns across data sets so, for example, say we're looking at a dataset of people in the hospital and were trying to predict whether they will develop a certain type of cancer. So chances are we're going to have a lot of people in that dataset who don't have cancer, and there will only be a few who have the cancer. However what we want to learn about are the ones who have the cancer but if we just plug all that data into the model it can still get a high accuracy by predicting they won't have cancer 100 percent of the time, so we are trying to find ways to to get a higher accuracy with that minority class.\\n𝑯𝒐𝒘 𝒉𝒂𝒔 𝒕𝒉𝒊𝒔 𝒓𝒆𝒔𝒆𝒂𝒓𝒄𝒉 𝒔𝒉𝒂𝒑𝒆𝒅 𝒚𝒐𝒖𝒓 𝒆𝒅𝒖𝒄𝒂𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏?\\nI have found research to be a great way to learn outside of the classroom. I can't speak to other disciplines, but in computer science in class you're still problem-solving but its in a very different way than research because for homework you have a task that has been done many times over that people have practiced forever, but in research it demands creativity, and you have to figure out where you're going. \\n𝑾𝒉𝒂𝒕 𝒊𝒔 𝒔𝒐𝒎𝒆𝒕𝒉𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝒊𝒎𝒑𝒐𝒓𝒕𝒂𝒏𝒕 𝒚𝒐𝒖 𝒉𝒂𝒗𝒆 𝒍𝒆𝒂𝒓𝒏𝒆𝒅 𝒇𝒓𝒐𝒎 𝒚𝒐𝒖𝒓 𝒎𝒆𝒏𝒕𝒐𝒓?\\nI have learned to be thorough and patient from my mentor. Some of our experiments we have to run 3 or 4 times from the top because there was one error where we had to check the data was being processed in a particular way. It was very easy to get involved with research. I was very intimidated in the beginning because I didn't know how competitive it was, but I just asked my professor, and he helped me out.\\n#stem #research #undergraduate #oberlincollege #computerscience\",\n",

In an unprecedented run of promiscuity in the span of a only a week, Ty manages to impregnate three women: his ex- girlfriend, his 40-something, married next-door neighbor, and his 18-year-old student. ‘All This Intimacy’ follows Ty as he navigates this pregnant predicament.\",\n",

       "   'output': 'Underrepresentation in STEM:\\nHow Far Can She Go?\\n\\n\"According to McKinsey’s 2020 report Diversity wins: How inclusion matters, companies in the top quartile in terms of gender diversity on their leadership\\nteams were “25% more likely to have above-average profitability than companies in the fourth quartile.” On a larger scale, emphasis on gender equality boosts countries\\' economies as well. A report published by European Institute for Gender Equality shows that by improving gender equality, the European Union can experience a 6.1-9.6 percent increase in GDP by 2050. In every professional field, diversity is an important element for success, as it helps to avoid potential short-sightedness and stubbornness. However, researchers who identify as female are typically underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Consider the National Foundation of Science’s report on female representation in STEM and health fields, published in 2018. In all surveyed fields, the percentage\\nof female graduate students is 46.2 percent. Although there has been a slight improvement over the years, it has been diminished by the negative impacts of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\"\\n\\nContinue reading in Issue 26 on our website.

Originally from Taiwan, Tsai traveled to the United States in 1981 for his postgraduate studies at the University of Tennessee. He then earned his postgraduate degree in materials science as well as completing over 500 credits in math, physics, and chemistry. Tsai became a professor at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, while conducting research at the same time. In particular, he was attempting to develop a material that would filter air through electrostatically fibers. Eventually, this fiber would create the N95 mask, whose original intent was to filter out dust or other microparticles used in construction, but in 1996 the US Centers for Disease and Control discovered that these masks could also be used to protect people from viruses as well. Peter Tsai entered retirement in 2019, but came out of retirement in 2020, during the midst of the pandemic, to resolve the problem of the depletion of N95 masks. Tsai was able to devise a way to reuse the masks without compromising their protective qualities. Through his invention of the N95 mask, Peter Tsai was able to save millions of lives from harmful particles and diseases. OUR recognizes Peter Tsai’s lifesaving contribution to science and abroad!\\n\\n#diversity #oberlin #OUR #research #AAPIHeritageMonth',\n",

       "   'output': 'OUR is recognizing the work of Katsuko Saruhashi (1920-2007), a Japanese geochemist that discovered a way to measure the sea levels of carbon dioxide, also known as Saruhashi’s table. Additionally, she discovered that the sea releases twice as much carbon dioxide, a significant finding as it indicates that the absorption of carbon dioxide by the sea cannot completely mitigate the effects of global warming. Saruhashi also found a way to measure nuclear contamination that resulted from oceanic nuclear testing in Bikini Atoll in seawater, which proved to be significant. As a result, limits to nuclear testing have now been established to deter further nuclear contamination harmful to people. Throughout her professional life, Saruhashi battled against racial and gender discrimination. To create a more welcoming environment for women in science fields, she established the Society of Japanese Women Scientists, which recognized the work and provided support for female Japanese scientists. Furthermore, she founded the Saruhashi Prize in 1981, which recognized Japanese women scientists for their significant contributions to science. We are inspired by the distinguishing work of Katsuko Saruhashi and are grateful for her commitment to equity in STEM! \\n\\n#diversity #oberlin #OUR #research',\n",

Mentions of physical effects of trauma, dissociation, anger, violence, shame.\\n\\nExperiences with sexual harm and gender based violence can affect your emotions throughout your life, even if it’s been a long time since you first experienced harm. Consent violations or emotional betrayal can shatter your sense of normalcy and leave you reeling from the traumatic backlash. It is normal to experience anger in response to traumatic events.\\n\\nYet we often fear or avoid anger because of its perceived destructive effects. We throw around statements like, “hurt people hurt people,” as though it’s a given that anger stemming from hurt will harm those around us. If you watched parents express anger with violence or abuse, you’re more likely to be primed to believe that anger is unacceptable. However, anger is not inherently bad nor is it harmful.\\n\\nFor more on this topic, visit SOSHA’s resource library (in bio) and attend our Thursday listening sessions 4/18 at 12:30 and 6pm in Wilder 215',\n",

Wonderful pieces of art that got cut short due to COVID-19.\\n\\nWe start with “In the Eleventh Hour,” a LabSeries devised and directed by Miyah Byers ‘20 and devised and performed by Jaris Owens ‘20. A one-act original play comprised of sampled writing from Black poets, musicians and literary giants, “In the Eleventh Hour” follows character Paul, who when facing the threat of death calls on God and the ancestors to save him. When they answer, Paul is taken on a spiritual journey throughout time in the hopes of delivering his final, urgent message about the future of Black people in America.\\n.\\nDirector and playwright Miyah Byers beautifully illustrates the show’s influences and future:\\n“We find ourselves at a critical point in American history, especially in the time of COVID-19. We say in history because yes, we are living inside of history, making and shaping it every day. When we began our work on this show, we had no idea that the deadly coronavirus pandemic would sweep the earth and make our work as artists that much more pressing and relevant to the times. When we began our work on this show, we had no idea that the rage, frustration, joy and love that comes from our experience of being Black in America would become even more complicated as the pandemic has so deeply impacted our Black communities in America. Never have we been so sad for our people, and unfortunately, never have we had so little faith in our country and our administration to do right by us. It was the great and prolific James Baldwin who said that “To be a Negro in this country and to be relatively conscious is to be in a rage almost all the time.”’ This sentiment resonates with us at this moment as racism has prevailed in America for the last 400+ years, and the same evil roots of inequality that were planted in the days of slavery continue to blossom and grow in the days of COVID-19 as Black Americans are disproportionately affected by the virus...” (quote continued in the comments)',\n",

       "   'output': 'To close out our season retrospective, we come to our final MainStage, the MainStage that almost was, \"Peter and the Starcatcher\" directed by Chris Flaharty.\\n.\\n“Peter and the Starcatcher” fantastically explores the creation of Neverland, a swashbuckling “what-if?” prequel to J. M. Barrie’s beloved Peter Pan. The play traverses, as director Chris Flaharty reveals, “high melodrama, low farce, sweet pathos, [and] dramatic adventure.” Just as Peter Pan asked of us a century ago, \"Peter and the Starcatcher\" questions “What is home? And in whom can we find a family?”\\n.\\n.\\nHere is director Chris Flaharty’s touching reflection on his time in rehearsal and post COVID-19 for “Peter and the Starcatcher”:\\n.\\n“The process of play production means many things: creativity, discipline, imagination, rigor, challenge, sweat, fun… and the more, the better! For many artists, creating a play is mostly about this process—the greatest fulfillment can come from working, sharing and living with the sense of community that such a very particular group endeavor generates. And because of a fateful surprise, the cast and creators of our spring production of \"Peter and the Starcatcher\" have been allowed only that satisfaction, thanks to the sharp, final blow from Covid-19 that stopped production in its tracks, just as the process was really taking off in a big way. \\nBut rather than lamenting the exuberant thrill of sharing our performances with an audience, it’s my hope that everyone involved in Starcatcher has come away with a deep satisfaction in the work they did, the fun they had and the beauty of the process of working together to create some good art. You all deserve that gratification. I’m proud and delighted to have shared that experience with every one of you! \\nI want to thank and thank again every member of that well-oiled ensemble, a prodigiously talented team: my design and production colleagues and administrative buddies, the show’s execution crews, Cass and her fantastic stage management team, Tempest, Lauren and Joey, and certainly the great ensemble of actors who played hard, worked brilliantly—and hey, tumbled through a run before the end!”',\n",

       "   'output': 'Post-Thanksgiving break, you can feel the anxiety and dread within the walls of Oberlin College. The event that we all anticipate yet hate is dawning on us: finals. Like most colleges and universities across the country, finals at Oberlin are summative assessments for your courses, often the largest projects of the semester. Unlike other assessments during the school year, they all fall within a five-day period — this year from Dec. 17–21. Finals are preceded by reading period — four days designed to be solely dedicated for students to study and prepare for their finals. Official sports practices stop, club meetings become rare, and Mudd Center is filled with students until midnight. The usual Oberlin student body, which enjoys overwhelming themselves with as many social activities and extracurriculars as possible, becomes entrenched in academics. While the entire ordeal only spans nine days, it is one of the most exhausting and hated experiences I have been through at Oberlin.\\n\\nMy first semester last year, I heavily relied on reading period to prepare for my final assessments, as many students do. Classes, my extracurriculars, and playing a sport had made the idea of preparing early for finals seem daunting. I told myself that I would be able to write the majority of my essays and study for my tests during reading period. I woke up each day at 8 a.m. and studied until 1:30 a.m. in Mudd Center, the Science Center, or study rooms. I took breaks only to eat or go for a short walk. Every three hours, I took an Advil to help alleviate my stress headaches, and had at least two coffees a day to keep my mind awake. Once this awful period finally ended, I returned home and slept for 13 hours and found myself painfully sick for the next two weeks. I unfortunately did not learn from my mistakes, repeating a similar process in my second semester.

       "   'output': 'My first year at Oberlin, I found myself isolated from my Latino community. Oberlin boasts diversity and inclusion throughout campus but, in reality, most BIPOC students struggle to adjust and find community in a predominantly white institution. For many, the difficulty is in finding the group of peers that create that sense of community. I want this piece to serve as a resource for students on campus who are currently feeling disconnected from their identity-based circles. It wasn’t until I reached out and connected with those around me by joining La Alianza Latinx last spring that I fully realized the vividness of student-led groups. Since Latino Heritage Month recently came to an end, I believe it is appropriate to talk about the different efforts student organizations and members of faculty and staff are making to help the diverse communities on campus.\\n\\nOne of these individuals is Assistant Director for Career Readiness Vilmarie Perez, who is of Puerto Rican descent. In her year at Oberlin, Perez has devoted her time to finding ways to be involved with BIPOC students on campus. Perez connects with BIPOC students not only through her office hours, but also with the events she coordinates.\\n\\n“My main motivation is to serve BIPOC students, Latinx students, and students with disabilities,” Perez said. “I believe that representation matters. I think that I’ve been privileged to be able to facilitate a safe space for BIPOC and Latinx students.”\\n\\n📰Article by Kimberly Rodríguez Arroyo \\n📷Photo credits: Serafina Yan',\n",

We know their deaths represent a tragic reality that shapes the lives of many of our students as well as countless Black and Brown people throughout our country. We support our students who are finding ways to protest these injustices and are committed to raising consciousness and awareness around these issues in our work and curriculum. Although the Oberlin College Theater department has a long and proud history of celebrating Black theatre on our stages and in our classes, we also recognize the need to be ever vigilant and reflective in our own department as we continue to challenge notions and practices that marginalize the creative traditions and talents of non-White peoples. To this end, this year we plan to allocate resources for a series of workshops, forums, and/or guest speakers that work specifically to dismantle notions of White supremacy in our field and continue to use theatre as a tool for social change. Ultimately, we work to inspire the tremendous gifts of our students and arm them with the creative and academic tools that will allow them to make a life-long impact on our world and the communities they represent.\"',\n",

They say, “it’s good for you” and that “it will make you stronger.” However, different sources of protein and their respective nutritional values are discussed less frequently. Perhaps animal protein is the best source, since animal meat is more likely than plant-based protein to contain all nine essential amino acids. However, not all proteins affect our bodies in the same way. Researchers have discovered stark differences between animal protein and plant protein. While vegetarians and vegans deal with common misconceptions about their plant-based diet, they may be avoiding certain health outcomes that meat-eaters could be subject to. At the same time, animal protein may have more nutritional value than plant protein.\"\\n\\nContinue reading in Issue 28.

The first Posse Scholars from Houston will begin studies alongside the 19th Chicago cohort. \\\\n\\\\n“We are proud of our long and productive history with the Posse Foundation, and we will recruit Chicago Posse #18 this year,” Manuel Carballo, vice president and dean of Admissions and Financial Aid, wrote in an email to the Review. “We recruited our first Posse cohort in 2006 and have welcomed more than 170 Posse Scholars to campus since then. The Admissions Office works with a number of community-based organizations and programs that help us find amazing, talented students who might not otherwise be exposed to colleges like Oberlin.”\\\\n\\\\nThe College has received a $500,000, five-year grant that will help expand into Houston and strengthen Oberlin’s commitment to the program.

Impacts of sexual violence: Disconnect with spirit, culture, or self. Physical injury - lasting short or long term. Trauma, hyper-vigilance, flashbacks. Difficulty trusting or believing others. Entire medicine wheel: spiritual, physical, emotional, mental. \\\\n\\\\n2) Sexual violence is pervasive. American Indians are 2.5 times more likely to experience sexual assault compared to all other races. 34% of Native women are raped in their lifetimes. At least 84% of perpetrators of these crimes are non-Native men. \\\\n\\\\n3) Sexual violence and trauma. Following an assault, common outcomes include poor mental health (PTSD, acute stress disorders, depression, sleep disorders, anxiety, suicidal ideation). Decreased sexual urges/pleasure, increased sexual risk behaviors, substance use and physical health problems. Revitalization (is) also commonly reported for Indigenous survivors of childhood sexual abuse. \\\\n\\\\n4) Sexual Violence is Preventable.

At 19, hooks began writing her book \"Ain\\\\\\'t I a Woman\", published a decade later. bell hooks continued her higher education and eventually obtained a doctorate in English literature at the University of California, Santa Cruz. After that, she began her teaching career, which she considered to be the most powerful form of political resistance.

You have food science to thank for that! Food science currently offers us exciting innovations that continue to better the quality of what we eat. However, food science suffers from an internal conflict: do we eat to live, or live to eat? In terms of science and its application to food, this means distinguishing between using science to improve food as a pragmatic product (e.g., through advancements in food safety, nutrition, and yield) and using it to improve the consumer\\\\\\'s aesthetic experience of food (e.g., through improving the sensory and psychological experiences). This dilemma has been reflected in the development of breakfast cereal. However, breakfast cereals can also show us that food\\\\\\'s aesthetic and pragmatic qualities are not always separate; the future of food science may even rely on merging these qualities. When one considers how food science has changed our relationship to food, especially in the case of breakfast cereal, the apparent split between the pragmatic and aesthetic diminishes, and the two categories can be seen intertwining and even merging.\"\\\\n\\\\nContinue reading in Issue 26 on our website.

Doing geology research in context to building computer programs allowed me to develop a deeper understanding of both fields. Once I figured out what I wanted to do with my life I started looking into graduate school programs for geology, something that as a computer science major I didn\\'t really have to do because it’s a little easier to get a job in. What’s really unique about research at Oberlin as an undergrad is that  we have a small team so we go out and collect the samples that we want. At other institutions it’s just a lot of research without the field work experience and I think the field work experience is one of the most valuable parts of geology. Having research experience prior to my first year helped me navigate my first year, it taught me to pick apart big projects, how to work as a team and that I was able to rely on other people and not just myself.\\\\n\\\\n𝑾𝒉𝒂𝒕 𝒊𝒔 𝒔𝒐𝒎𝒆𝒕𝒉𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝒊𝒎𝒑𝒐𝒓𝒕𝒂𝒏𝒕 𝒚𝒐𝒖 𝒉𝒂𝒗𝒆 𝒍𝒆𝒂𝒓𝒏𝒆𝒅 𝒇𝒓𝒐𝒎 𝒚𝒐𝒖𝒓 𝒎𝒆𝒏𝒕𝒐𝒓?\\\\nAmanda has taught me many things.

The science behind how those individuals came to look that way — and why they are carrying a gallon of water — is quite fascinating. Our understanding of what is required to achieve this hypermuscular state reaches down to the cellular level. Those who participate in bodybuilding must manipulate multiple metabolic pathways to achieve their desired result. The universal practice in this sport involves following a distinct diet combined with strenuous physical activity in order to minimize body fat and maximize muscle tissue. The Merriam Webster Dictionary defines bodybuilding as “the developing of the body through exercise and diet.” If bodybuilding was easy, then many more individuals would try to participate. It requires a substantial amount of discipline and mental strength. Critics may ask, “why going through such a rigorous diet and exercise routine is worth competing?” For those who make it to the professional level, the top placements receive prize money, and for many, the experience of winning is a compelling enough reason to continue.\"\\\\n\\\\nContinue reading in Issue 26 on our website.

Ocampo-Friedmann was born in Manila, Philippines and obtained a degree in botany from the University of the Philippines in 1958. She then completed her master’s at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem before returning to the Philippines to work. In 1973, she obtained a PhD at Florida State University. Ocampo-Friedmann and her husband often traveled to conduct research on algae and microorganisms. In particular, their trip to the Dry Valleys located in Antarctica was groundbreaking. The Dry Valleys are devoid of ice and snow and are characterized by their low humidity, so when the couple found microorganisms, now known as cryptoendoliths, living within the rock under extreme conditions, this discovery has implications for life in extreme environments. The couple successfully grew a culture of these microorganisms in a laboratory, and after writing a paper highlighting their discovery, their research supported the theory of the possibility of life on Mars.

Hurston was born in Notasulga, Alabama, on January 7, 1891, but her family moved to Eatonville, Florida, shortly after, a place that would inspire many of her later works. Hurston attended Howard University and then Barnard College, where she received a B.A. in anthropology in 1928. Hurston traveled through the American South and the Caribbean, documenting Black folklore, publishing her work of literary anthropology, \"Mules and Men\", in 1935. At the same time, Hurston was a leading figure of the Harlem Renaissance, working with Langston Hughes and Wallace Thurman. Many of her literary works discussed issues in Black communities and her struggles as a Black woman. In 1937, Hurston\\\\\\'s notable novel, \"Their Eyes Were Watching God\", was published. Throughout the 1940s and 50s, Hurston published works in periodicals. On January 28, 1960, Zora Neale Hurston passed away.

At 15, he was admitted to Lincoln College after taking an entrance exam. In 1915, he graduated with a degree in philosophy. Sumner then began attending Clark University in 1916 to attain a second degree in English. Soon after, he returned to Lincoln College to start his graduate studies in psychology but was interrupted when he was drafted during World War I. When he returned, he completed his dissertation, \"Psychoanalysis of Freud and Adler,\" and he became the first Black person to attain a PhD in Psychology. After his graduate studies, Sumner focused on \"race psychology\", specifically investigating the racial biases in psychology that resulted in theories claiming that African Americans were inferior. Sumner had difficulties receiving funding for his research throughout his career due to racial discrimination. The most extended position he held was the Chair of the Psychology Department at Howard University from 1928 to 1954. During that time, he established many reforms, the biggest being the Psychology Department\\\\\\'s separation from the Philosophy Department. After accomplishing much successful work in many fields, Francis Cecil Sumner passed away in 1954.

Central to the musical are the ways that corporate greed has, and will continue to, commodify and deplete our natural resources.\\\\n\\\\nIn this country today, where more than half of the citizens deny that the very real consequences of climate change will personally affect them, Wright asserts, “We need art that inspires action.” Through humor, Urinetown allows the audience to critically interrogate the pressing fears of our present climate crisis. “Though the play makes a joke of this essential human crisis,” Wright notes, “the intent is that we laugh at it derisively and thoughtfully and, perhaps, with more than a modicum of actual terror.”\\\\n.\\\\n.\\\\n.\\\\n.\\\\n.\\\\n#OberlinCollegeTheater\\\\xa0#OberlinCollege\\', \\'org\\': \\'oberlin.theater\\'}, {\\'input\\': \\'TO BE COMPLETED\\', \\'output\\': \"#BEHINDTHESCENES at Studio B. #SOUNDUP! #exclusive tour of the Engineer\\'s Booth\", \\'org\\': \\'livefromstudiob\\'}, {\\'input\\': \\'TO BE COMPLETED\\', \\'output\\': \\'Dress your best to win our employee of the month award 🥇 Please refer to our Solarity inc. outfit inspo!

I was there to see Fall Forward, the annual performance put on by the Oberlin College Dance department. Before I walked into the show, one of my friends told me that there was a controversy about a half-hour senior dance piece that was part of the program for the night. It was about whether or not a piece that took up three dance slots in the show should have been allowed or whether it should have been its own show entirely, as often happens with senior projects. I don’t know what prompted this piece to be placed in Fall Forward, but I’m very glad it was. I am referring to “Patient 6183,” choreographed by College fourth-year Liz Hawk.\\\\n\\\\nThe dance used multiple actors to represent the people in the story, even having them represent different versions of the same character. It used spoken word as well as dance to tell the story of a child who is diagnosed with severe scoliosis and consequently spends their whole life facing the fallout of it. The piece opens with a row of people in lab coats surrounding a bed occupied by a single person. The “doctors” begin listing the conditions of the patient, speaking over each other until the words are unintelligible \\\\xad— a mess of medical jargon. Then the person on the bed uses their own voice to tell the audience “how fucked up I am.” This set the tone for the whole piece, and simultaneously made me sit up and pay attention.\\\\n\\\\nI was diagnosed with a rare bone condition when I was seven years old. As a result of that, I have spent most of my life in and out of hospitals. I was subsequently diagnosed with several other exciting things like Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome — as fun as it sounds — and scoliosis — though not as bad as that of the subject of the dance. At this point I am well and able-bodied, but that makes me a medical anomaly and a fascination of doctors. I remember being so proud that the medical student assisting with my care wrote a paper about me when I was eight.....

Amidst the general unrest of 2020, politicians in the midst of heated discourse fueled by misinformation once again failed to adequately address the realities of catastrophic wildfires in the West. Every year, wildfires rage across North American wildlands, reigniting a highly politicized debate in the United States (U.S.) about the relationship between climate change and wildfire season. Climate change is not the reason there are wildfires in the United States, or anywhere for that matter. Periodic wildfires are essential to the natural cycles of many ecosystems around the world. What is concerning about recent wildfire seasons is the increased prevalence of large wildfires that often burn with greater intensity. Overwhelming evidence indicates that climate change is responsible for this trend. As this is likely to continue, a major shift in wildfire policy is necessary to mitigate the devastating ecological and socioeconomic impacts on the western U.S.\"\\\\n\\\\nContinue reading in Issue 27.

Logan Smalley (vocals, rhythm guitar), Noe Hernandez (drums), Roque Techera (lead guitar), and Curtis Bird (bass) have transformed their childhood friendship into a musical machine that is constantly running and brings new meaning to the phrase ‘rock ‘n roll’. Not all bands have their members actively pursuing degrees in financial planning, graphic design, law, double bass, and environmental studies, but these guys do it all. Through all the study sessions and challenging exams, Kenton Place powers through, working with industry leads such as: Grammy Award-nominated producer Ulrich Wild (Pantera, Breaking Benjamin, Deftones, and Slipknot); Grammy Award-winning Ted Jensen (Evanescence, Green Day, Billy Joel, and Norah Jones); Ken Stringfellow (The Posies, REM); and Derrick McKinney, founder and CEO of L.O.U.D. Muzik. Their act has graced the stages of world-famous venues such as the House of Blues and White Oak Music Hall in Houston, and the SXSW Austin Showcase. Their music has been featured on Houston’s premier rock station 94.5 The Buzz.

We\\'re looking at patterns across data sets so, for example, say we\\'re looking at a dataset of people in the hospital and were trying to predict whether they will develop a certain type of cancer. So chances are we\\'re going to have a lot of people in that dataset who don\\'t have cancer, and there will only be a few who have the cancer. However what we want to learn about are the ones who have the cancer but if we just plug all that data into the model it can still get a high accuracy by predicting they won\\'t have cancer 100 percent of the time, so we are trying to find ways to to get a higher accuracy with that minority class.\\\\n𝑯𝒐𝒘 𝒉𝒂𝒔 𝒕𝒉𝒊𝒔 𝒓𝒆𝒔𝒆𝒂𝒓𝒄𝒉 𝒔𝒉𝒂𝒑𝒆𝒅 𝒚𝒐𝒖𝒓 𝒆𝒅𝒖𝒄𝒂𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏?\\\\nI have found research to be a great way to learn outside of the classroom.

A report published by European Institute for Gender Equality shows that by improving gender equality, the European Union can experience a 6.1-9.6 percent increase in GDP by 2050. In every professional field, diversity is an important element for success, as it helps to avoid potential short-sightedness and stubbornness. However, researchers who identify as female are typically underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Consider the National Foundation of Science’s report on female representation in STEM and health fields, published in 2018. In all surveyed fields, the percentage\\\\nof female graduate students is 46.2 percent.

Today’s featured researcher is Peter Tsai, a Taiwanese American material scientist who invented the N95 respirator. Originally from Taiwan, Tsai traveled to the United States in 1981 for his postgraduate studies at the University of Tennessee. He then earned his postgraduate degree in materials science as well as completing over 500 credits in math, physics, and chemistry. Tsai became a professor at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, while conducting research at the same time. In particular, he was attempting to develop a material that would filter air through electrostatically fibers. Eventually, this fiber would create the N95 mask, whose original intent was to filter out dust or other microparticles used in construction, but in 1996 the US Centers for Disease and Control discovered that these masks could also be used to protect people from viruses as well. Peter Tsai entered retirement in 2019, but came out of retirement in 2020, during the midst of the pandemic, to resolve the problem of the depletion of N95 masks. Tsai was able to devise a way to reuse the masks without compromising their protective qualities. Through his invention of the N95 mask, Peter Tsai was able to save millions of lives from harmful particles and diseases.

Saruhashi also found a way to measure nuclear contamination that resulted from oceanic nuclear testing in Bikini Atoll in seawater, which proved to be significant. As a result, limits to nuclear testing have now been established to deter further nuclear contamination harmful to people. Throughout her professional life, Saruhashi battled against racial and gender discrimination. To create a more welcoming environment for women in science fields, she established the Society of Japanese Women Scientists, which recognized the work and provided support for female Japanese scientists. Furthermore, she founded the Saruhashi Prize in 1981, which recognized Japanese women scientists for their significant contributions to science.

A one-act original play comprised of sampled writing from Black poets, musicians and literary giants, “In the Eleventh Hour” follows character Paul, who when facing the threat of death calls on God and the ancestors to save him. When they answer, Paul is taken on a spiritual journey throughout time in the hopes of delivering his final, urgent message about the future of Black people in America.\\\\n.\\\\nDirector and playwright Miyah Byers beautifully illustrates the show’s influences and future:\\\\n“We find ourselves at a critical point in American history, especially in the time of COVID-19. We say in history because yes, we are living inside of history, making and shaping it every day. When we began our work on this show, we had no idea that the deadly coronavirus pandemic would sweep the earth and make our work as artists that much more pressing and relevant to the times. When we began our work on this show, we had no idea that the rage, frustration, joy and love that comes from our experience of being Black in America would become even more complicated as the pandemic has so deeply impacted our Black communities in America. Never have we been so sad for our people, and unfortunately, never have we had so little faith in our country and our administration to do right by us. It was the great and prolific James Baldwin who said that “To be a Negro in this country and to be relatively conscious is to be in a rage almost all the time.”’ This sentiment resonates with us at this moment as racism has prevailed in America for the last 400+ years, and the same evil roots of inequality that were planted in the days of slavery continue to blossom and grow in the days of COVID-19 as Black Americans are disproportionately affected by the virus...” (quote continued in the comments)', 'org': 'oberlin.theater'}, {'input': 'TO BE COMPLETED', 'output': 'Come to our paper folding workshop today at the Oberlin Public Library!

For many artists, creating a play is mostly about this process—the greatest fulfillment can come from working, sharing and living with the sense of community that such a very particular group endeavor generates. And because of a fateful surprise, the cast and creators of our spring production of \"Peter and the Starcatcher\" have been allowed only that satisfaction, thanks to the sharp, final blow from Covid-19 that stopped production in its tracks, just as the process was really taking off in a big way. \\\\nBut rather than lamenting the exuberant thrill of sharing our performances with an audience, it’s my hope that everyone involved in Starcatcher has come away with a deep satisfaction in the work they did, the fun they had and the beauty of the process of working together to create some good art. You all deserve that gratification. I’m proud and delighted to have shared that experience with every one of you! \\\\nI want to thank and thank again every member of that well-oiled ensemble, a prodigiously talented team: my design and production colleagues and administrative buddies, the show’s execution crews, Cass and her fantastic stage management team, Tempest, Lauren and Joey, and certainly the great ensemble of actors who played hard, worked brilliantly—and hey, tumbled through a run before the end!”\\', \\'org\\': \\'oberlin.theater\\'}, {\\'input\\': \\'TO BE COMPLETED\\', \\'output\\': \\'Join us this Tuesday at 8 PM for the dating game!

The event that we all anticipate yet hate is dawning on us: finals. Like most colleges and universities across the country, finals at Oberlin are summative assessments for your courses, often the largest projects of the semester. Unlike other assessments during the school year, they all fall within a five-day period — this year from Dec. 17–21. Finals are preceded by reading period — four days designed to be solely dedicated for students to study and prepare for their finals. Official sports practices stop, club meetings become rare, and Mudd Center is filled with students until midnight. The usual Oberlin student body, which enjoys overwhelming themselves with as many social activities and extracurriculars as possible, becomes entrenched in academics. While the entire ordeal only spans nine days, it is one of the most exhausting and hated experiences I have been through at Oberlin.\\\\n\\\\nMy first semester last year, I heavily relied on reading period to prepare for my final assessments, as many students do. Classes, my extracurriculars, and playing a sport had made the idea of preparing early for finals seem daunting. I told myself that I would be able to write the majority of my essays and study for my tests during reading period. I woke up each day at 8 a.m. and studied until 1:30 a.m. in Mudd Center, the Science Center, or study rooms. I took breaks only to eat or go for a short walk. Every three hours, I took an Advil to help alleviate my stress headaches, and had at least two coffees a day to keep my mind awake. Once this awful period finally ended, I returned home and slept for 13 hours and found myself painfully sick for the next two weeks. I unfortunately did not learn from my mistakes, repeating a similar process in my second semester.

Oberlin boasts diversity and inclusion throughout campus but, in reality, most BIPOC students struggle to adjust and find community in a predominantly white institution. For many, the difficulty is in finding the group of peers that create that sense of community. I want this piece to serve as a resource for students on campus who are currently feeling disconnected from their identity-based circles. It wasn’t until I reached out and connected with those around me by joining La Alianza Latinx last spring that I fully realized the vividness of student-led groups. Since Latino Heritage Month recently came to an end, I believe it is appropriate to talk about the different efforts student organizations and members of faculty and staff are making to help the diverse communities on campus.\\\\n\\\\nOne of these individuals is Assistant Director for Career Readiness Vilmarie Perez, who is of Puerto Rican descent. In her year at Oberlin, Perez has devoted her time to finding ways to be involved with BIPOC students on campus. Perez connects with BIPOC students not only through her office hours, but also with the events she coordinates.\\\\n\\\\n“My main motivation is to serve BIPOC students, Latinx students, and students with disabilities,” Perez said. “I believe that representation matters.
