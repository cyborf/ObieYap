However, it is possible to ingest too much and feel negative side effects, though these are not long-term detrimental effects. What exactly are the effects of caffeine on the body? Similar to other CNS stimulants, caffeine increases one’s blood pressure, heart rate, and alertness. When taken in moderate amounts, such as drinking one cup of coffee or tea, caffeine can maximize post-exercise recovery and even help protect against neurodegenerative diseases and cancers.\"\n\nContinue reading in Issue 27 on our website.

        "output": "The Oberlin Djembe Orchestra, created by Visiting Instructor of West African Drumming Weedie Braimah in the fall of last year, asks students to reshape their understanding of music. Braimah, a Grammy-nominated djembefola, offers a window into West African culture in his course. Braimah, who was born in Ghana and grew up in St. Louis, is not a percussionist — he plays only one instrument. His work collaborating with artists and teaching has aided in keeping the djembe tradition alive.\n\n“One of the first things [Braimah] tells us is that if you’re coming to this class to be in a drum circle or improve your rhythm and beat counting, this class is not for you,” College fourth-year Chudi Martin Jr., who has been playing with the Djembe Orchestra since its inception, said. “The expectations, demands, and needs of this course are going to be drastically different.”\n\nMany believe the origins of the djembe can be traced back to the 12th Century. Historians generally credit blacksmiths in the Malinke tribe of modern-day Mali for stretching the first rawhide across a djembe. As the empire of Mali expanded, and people migrated to modern-day Senegal, Mauritania, Guinea, and beyond, djembe music evolved and diversified. According to their descendants, the word djembe comes from the saying, “anke djé, anke be,” which means “everyone gather together in peace.” This also defines the djembe’s main purpose.\n\n📰Article by Nicolas Stebbins\n📷Photo credits: Erin Koo",

Tommy graduated from Oberlin in 1998 with a double major in Theater and English, and a minor in Philosophy. While at Oberlin, he performed in “Cloud 9” directed by David Walker ‘72, “Bent” directed by Jeremy Cohen ‘95, and a devised dance-theater piece with local children directed by Nusha Martynuk. Tommy also directed “American Buffalo”, “The Visit”, “Waiting for Godot”, and was the co-director of an experimental troupe, /twelv/, with Max Truax ‘98. Tommy’s company, ArKtype, began in 2005 and produces experimental multi-disciplinary work with major venues and festivals worldwide. Collaborations include Peter Brook, Mikhail Baryshnikov, Big Dance Theater, John Cameron Mitchell, Bryce Dessner, Kaneza Schaal, Daniel Fish, Yael Farber, 600 Highwaymen, Sam Green, Julie Atlas Muz, nora chipaumire, CHRISTEENE, Penny Arcade, Ocean Vuong and many more. His Broadway debut ILLINOISE, a dance-theater adaptation of the Sufjan Stevens album by Jackie Sybblies Drury and Justin Peck, opens today at the St. James Theater and has already received Outer Critics and Drama League nominations, and he was shortlisted for an Oscar this year for Sam Green’s live cinema documentary 32 SOUNDS with JD Samson.\n\nTommy had this to say about his time doing theater at Oberlin: “As an environment Oberlin was all about pushing for a unique vision - all of my pursuits since have sought developmental paths unique to the work’s form. Caroline Jackson-Smith, Roger Copeland, and so many more lit up my world with essential languages of performance and their origins and that’s guided my approach every step of the way. All of our experiments were done with essential support from OSTA.”",

She graduated from her high school class as valedictorian and received a full ride to Virginia State University. She graduated from college in 1952 with a degree in mathematics. She then taught math and science courses before returning to Virginia State to complete a Masters of Mathematics in 1955. After graduating, West was hired to work at the Naval Proving Ground, located in Dahlgren, Virginia. During her early time there, she was involved as a computer programmer and managed data processing systems. West was one of the only Black employees, and was the second Black woman to work there. Simultaneously, she earned a second master’s in public administration. In 1960, West participated in groundbreaking research that proved Pluto’s motion relative to Neptune’s. After this, she began working with data from satellites. In the 1980s, West programmed calculations to model the shape of the Earth. Her designs were the basis of the modern GPS system. She retired in 1998, and received a PhD in public administration after retiring. She was inducted into the US Air Force Hall of Fame in 2018. OUR honors the great work that Gladys West has done, and the dedication she demonstrated to her field. #OUR #research #oberlin #diversity", "org": "oberlinour"}

In readings, discussions, research and performance of scenes in class, we observe changes in voice, style and narrative in American theatrical writing.  As the end of the 20th century approached, how did these playwrights read their changing times, calculate the weight of history and invent new forms of expression?  How has that process continued into the 21st century? We interrogate the ways in which race, cultural identifications, gender, sexual orientation, gender identities, class and regionality play roles in the development of writers’ voices. \n\n📷 Tanya Rosen-Jones '97", "org": "oberlin.theater"}

This is a huge task and it’s hard to know how or where to start, but here are a couple goals I propose: talk about the history and context of ballet (it isn’t an entity that exists all on its own, there is culture that shaped/shapes ballet), liberate our bodies in the practice instead of confining them (find freedom within boundaries). This class is in large part influenced by the work of Katy Pyle and the Ballez company and class in New York. Our class here at Oberlin will consist of a set barre and center and then choreography in the last 30 minutes.

{"input": "Write feature post about the Poiesis Quartet's success and formation", "output": "Quoted as an “emerging young ensemble to watch” by the Hyde Park Herald, the Poiesis Quartet was formed at Oberlin College and Conservatory during the fall semester of 2022. The members of the quartet are Conservatory fourth-year violinist Sarah Ying Ma, Conservatory fourth-year violinist Max Ball, violist Jasper de Boor, OC ’23, and double-degree fourth-year cellist Drew Dansby. The quartet found success very quickly, including achievements such as the gold medal at the Saint Paul String Quartet Competition and first place at the Fischoff National Chamber Music Competition. Only Dansby and Ma were interviewed for this article.\n\nHow did the quartet form? SYM: I wanted to do competitions, specifically the Fischoff Chamber Music Competition because I had never done it before. When I transferred from Juilliard in January 2022, I was looking for a group, but I didn’t know anybody. I asked Drew, because I knew we had mutual friends from social media. Originally, we were going for a piano trio, but we found Jasper and Max, and we got together to play. We all agreed on competitions as a group, and we did the Advanced Quartet Seminar together in our first semester.\n\nAt what point did you recognize your success as a group? SYM: After performing at the St. Paul Competition we listened back to our performance, and that was the first time I really thought to myself, “Oh, wow, we actually have something good.” And I remember before that I would listen to our recordings and always have a problem with it. I would think that we would never win anything. After the St. Paul Competition, we won the gold medal, and the BIPOC/Female Composer prize, which we did not think we would win.  But when we listened to it back, I felt like there’s something. There’s an energy here that I never had before in a chamber group. And I was interested in it. And I started exploring it more in rehearsals. I still — even to this day — think all four of us have doubts about ourselves as a group; we still question whether we could work together. But we are all committed to getting to a point where we feel secure in that.\n\n📰Article by: Emir Efe \n📷Photo credits: Peter Ringenberg", "org": "ocreview"}

The celebrations continued year after year.\n.\n.\n It’s important to note that, Juneteenth isn’t a straightforward story of emancipation, nor did it necessarily improve conditions for many African Americans the next day or even the next decade. \n  Erin Stewart Mauldin said “Juneteenth is neither the beginning nor the end of something. The end of the Civil War and the ending of slavery didn’t happen overnight and was a lot more like a jagged edge than a clean cut.”\n.\n.\nOn that note, do your own research on Juneteenth and learn the history. Don’t forget to come out tomorrow, June 18th for the Juneteenth block party with ABUSUA! \n\nSource: \nhttps://www.stpetersburg.usf.edu/news/2021/juneteenth-complicated-history-significance-celebration-around-struggle-for-freedom.aspx", "org": "oberlinabusua"}

{"input": "Reflect on experiences with Oberlin's Gender, Sexuality, and Feminist Studies major", "output": "One of the reasons I was attracted to Oberlin was its Gender, Sexuality, and Feminist Studies major. I appreciated that I’d be able to explore my interest in gender studies, and valued the interdisciplinary and intersectional nature of the major, which aims to center issues of sexuality, queerness, and race within gender. As someone interested in the specific experiences of Black and queer women, this was very exciting to me. Unfortunately the major was not as intersectional as I had hoped.\n\nMy first semester at Oberlin, I enrolled in a course called Introduction to Gender, Sexuality, and Feminist Studies. I examined the syllabus with an excited eye. The readings were from many of my favorite authors and intellectuals like Angela Davis, Bell Hooks, and June Jordan, along with an array of authors whose work I had not been exposed to. Despite the diversity emphasized in the course readings, I attended the class and was surprised to find that I was one of a handful of students of color in attendance.\n\nOver time I quickly noticed the impact that the racial makeup of the class had on student-led discussions. While analyzing systems of oppression was expected in classroom discussions, many students who were not POC discussed America’s systems of oppression without race in mind. When referring to America’s power system, which subjugates Brown, Black, impoverished, and queer people, students harshly critiqued the system, rarely acknowledging their own participation and place in upholding the system they critiqued. I remember a particular white student who would often remark on the amusingly cringey things white people would do. Afterward, many other white students in the class would agree and remarked on their own experiences of “ridiculous things white people would say.” Click link in bio for more!\n\n📰Article by Avery Russell \n📷Photo credits: Abe Frato", "org": "ocreview"}

For theater artists, Zoom inhabits a space somewhere between live performance and digital recording that we are still in the process of mapping out. \n\nFor this production of Fires in the Mirror, we have embraced the unfortunately familiar aesthetic of Zoom as we perform in this uncharted territory. Performance on theZoom is neither live theater, nor is it fully edited filmmaking. Technology and slick production technique has rendered the artifice of realistic filmmaking invisible to the general public. Since Fires in the Mirror deals with issues of identity and subjective perspectives, in our design we have embraced artificiality and foregrounded the technology we are using for our production. Both the script and our design acknowledge that any performative re-creation of an historical event are necessarily distanced from an mediated for the viewer.” \n- Jason Dorwart, Director of Fires in the Mirror\n\nRegister for Fires in the Mirror from the link in our bio!\n\nPictured above: Laura Carlson-Tarantowski renderings of the film's aesthetic", "org": "oberlin.theater"},

You do not have to spend more than $15 on a gift unless you feel inclined to do so! \n— \n\nA White Elephant Gift Exchange is a popular Christmas event where people vie to walk away with the best present. Here are the rules: \n\n1. Each player brings one wrapped gift to contribute to a common pool\n\n2. Players draw numbers to determine what order they will go in\n\n3. The first player selects a gift from the pool and opens it where everyone can see \n\n4. The following players can choose to either pick an unwrapped gift from the pool or steal a previous player’s gift. Anyone who gets their gift stolen in this way can do the same –choose a new gift or steal from someone else. \n\n5. After a gift is stolen twice, there will be a block on that gift and it can no longer be taken ! \n\n6. After all players have had a turn, the first player gets a chance to swap the gift he or she is holding for any other opened gift.  If they choose to end with their gift, the game is over, if they choose to swap, we continue swapping until someone concedes and sticks with their gift ! \n—-\nWe can’t wait to see you for a night of mischief and fun! Be on the look out as some of the board members will be giving rides for people to get their gifts!", "org": "oberlinabusua"}

The important work of M4BL, the #metoo movement, an increasing awareness of the breadth of gender identities and Queer folks in our culture, and centuries overdue justice for Black, Indigenous, and People of Color, all REQUIRE that movement forward in this time reflect a genuine commitment to social justice. These questions arise in every area of what we do. Whether it's a question of programming plays that reflect the breadth of who we are, or how to create safe places in which to make our work without replicating the trauma we seek to expose and eradicate, our conscious effort must forever be to MAKE the world we wish to occupy.\n\nThis panel discussion will focus on a case study. Even as the #metoo movement was first signalling the urgency of protections for Women and Femme identities, and as Black Lives Matter was raising awareness of gross injustices, several members of the Cleveland Theater Community began to assemble a model for working: The CLEan House Document. In the midst of its roll-out, the pandemic forced closure of theaters across the greater Cleveland area. We will focus our discussion on the origins of that document, the progress made, and how it's evolved during the big pause. Joining us will be:\n\nNathan Motta: Artistic Director of Dobama Theater and one of the original drafters of the CLEan House Document\nColin Anderson: General Manager of Dobama Theater and vocal advocate for the LGBTQIA+ community\nNina Domingue-Glover: Award winning Actress, Director and Writer and original drafter of the CLEan House Document\nNicole Sumlin: Award winning Actress and Activist and inspiration for the CLEan House Document.", "org": "oberlin.theater"}

While she has a neurological condition that could suppress her immune system, she controls it with medication and is otherwise healthy. She contracted coronavirus disease 2019 back in April of 2020 and recounted her experience in an interview with Illinois Public Media. \nMayra went to the emergency room with low oxygen levels and was placed on a ventilator. What she thought would be a three-day stay turned into a six-week-long hell. She experienced nightmares, many involving her drowning, which she attributed to breathing difficulties. Mayra's family was told she might not even survive. But in June, the doctors suggested a life-saving measure: a double-lung transplant. Dr. Ankit Bharat, the Chief of Thoracic\nSurgery at Northwestern Medical, who operated on Mayra that month, said she was the sickest patient he has transplanted. Mayra was the first person to receive a double-lung transplant in the United States due to the virus. Since the operation, she is doing better but has to take various medications throughout the day to remain healthy. Mayra also faces at least a year of rehabilitation therapy before she can function independently.\"\n\nContinue reading in Issue 26 on our website.

It’s here where Red Baraat does what it does best - communing with their audience in a joyful, near hedonistic celebration of music and dance which, tellingly, draws a crowd even more diverse than the players on stage. The universality of what Red Baraat does is undeniable. And this is no happy accident. It is the product of intention and design. Says Jain, “The band…our songs…are addressing the multiplicity of viewpoints,” says Jain. “There’s ‘Zindabad,’ which means ‘Long Live’ in Hindi. In that song, we’re saying that we celebrate life, we celebrate devotion — but we also celebrate agitation and revolution. If we can unite people of all backgrounds and ethnicities to partake in the exuberance of life through the universal language of music, then life is that much sweeter.”", "org": "oberlin_solarity"}

This play allows me to wrap all of that together with everything I’ve learned from the theater faculty. ‘A Warsaw Melody’ is such an ensemble piece, I’ve loved working with Connor, he’s so committed and earnestly connected to the work, and Christine and I have taken (truly) every acting class together short of 100 our freshman year, so it’s really easy for us to communicate about the process.

This performance is especially significant to the group, comprised mainly of Class of 2020 alumni who are just now returning to their alma mater to celebrate graduation after the long exodus caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. \n\nThis evening's musical celebration is dedicated to the memory of Wendell and Bettye Logan. Dr. Wendell Logan created a place for Black American Music to thrive in Oberlin by tirelessly founding the Oberlin Jazz Studies Department. The band performs with gratitude to be a part of the Oberlin jazz legacy and eagerly awaits the chance to reconnect with current students, faculty, and community members.", "org": "oberlin_jazz_society"}

We need to understand how the pandemic played out in different countries. We need to understand what other cultural implications there are, what opportunities for learning there are between countries and cultures, and how this has impacted different people in different ways. There’s a really rich environment for learning right now, but at the same time, we need to be responsible and informed about what those learning experiences can look like.” 🌍 \nMore from the Arts section this week: a look at Prof. Talise Campbell’s Dance Dialogue series, and a profile of the Oberlin Afrikan-American Genealogy & History Group’s community-based and -building research in genealogy. 🌍 \n📸 Courtesy of the Office of Communications", "org": "ocreview"}
